# Introduction: Why Does Finance Matter? 
In an environment with no information or transaction costs, there is no need for a financial (Kenneth Arrow (1964)-Gerard Debreu (1959)) institution.

Five basic functions of the financial systems(Levine, 1997).:
1. Facilitate exchange of goods and services
	1. Some Examples: 1) money vs. barter; 2) letter of credit, and 3) the foreign exchange market in international trade
	2. The invention of letter of credit significantly reduces the transaction costs in international trade.
	3. Foreign exchange markets allow for conversions of different currencies at a low cost, facilitating global trade and investments, and global financial transactions.
	4. The foreign exchange market also helps to manage foreign exchange risk, through futures and forwards.
2. Mobilize and pool savings
	1. The joint stock company in which many individuals invest in a new legal entity, the firm, represents a prime example of multiple bilateral mobilizations.
	2. Pooling may also occur through financial intermediaries such as banks, where investors entrust their wealth to financial intermediaries that invest in hundreds of firms.
3. Produce information about possible investments and allocate capital
	1. Financial intermediaries can undertake the costly process of researching investment possibilities for savers and thereby improve resource allocation.
	2. By improving information on firms, managers, and economic conditions, financial intermediaries can accelerate economic growth
4. Monitor investments and exert corporate governance
	1. For example, to the extent that shareholders and creditors effectively monitor firms and induce managers to maximize firm value, this will improve the efficiency with which firms allocate resources and make savers more willing to finance production and innovation.
5. Facilitate the trading, diversification, and management of risk
	1. Banks, mutual funds, and securities markets all provide vehicles for trading, pooling, and diversifying risk. Foreign exchange market also offer many tools for investors to reduce exchange risks.

How money reduces transaction costs
Money as a Medium of Exchange:
- Eliminates the trouble of finding a double coincidence of needs (reduces transaction costs!)
- Promotes specialization
Money as a Unit of Account:
- Used to measure value in the economy
- Reduces transaction costs!

The Dark Side of Finance
1. There are also theoretical studies show that, in an incomplete market economy, adding a market can possibly reduce social welfare (Hart, 1975; Elul,1995).
2. Without proper rules, finance can easily degenerate into a rent-seeking activity (Zingales’ 2015 AFA Presidential Address).
3. Many financial activities tend to have a private return that is much higher than the (perceived) social return.
4. Too much finance without proper regulations often lead to financial crises, and financial crises are very costly (e.g., Schularick and Taylor, 2012)

Basic Facts About Financial Structure Throughout the World
1. Stocks are not the most important sources of external financing for businesses.
2. Issuing marketable debt and equity securities is not the primary way in which businesses finance their operations.
3. Indirect finance via financial intermediaries is many times more important than direct finance.
4. Financial intermediaries, particularly banks, are the most important source of external funds used to finance businesses.

The data are from 1970–2000 and are gross flows as percentage of the total, not including trade and other credit data, which are not available.

5. The financial system is among the most heavily regulated sectors of the economy.
6. Only large, well-established corporations have easy access to securities markets to finance their activities.
7. Collateral is a prevalent feature of debt contracts for both households and businesses.
8. Debt contracts are extremely complicated legal documents that place substantial restrictive covenants on borrowers.

An Information/Transaction Cost Explanation of the Facts
Two types of asymmetric information problems that affect transaction costs: adverse selection and moral hazard.
- Adverse selection occurs before a transaction occurs.
- Moral hazard arises after the transaction has developed.
Agency theory analyses how asymmetric information problems affect economic behavior

# An Overview of China’s Financial System 
Key Features of the Chinese Financial System
- The formal financial system is dominated by banks, and the banking industry is dominated by a few very large state-owned commercial banks.
	- The scale of the banking industry far exceeds the total financing of the bond and the stock markets. The banking industry owns more than 95% of the financial system’s total assets.
	- In 2002, the loans by banks accounted for more than 90% of the flow of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE 社会融资规模). In 2018, it still accounted for 65% of the flow of AFRE.
	- ![Pasted image 20231127113738](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341223.png)
	- ![Pasted image 20231127113917](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341224.png)
- The informal financial sector plays an important role in firm financing, especially for private firms.
- Participation by domestic (foreign) investors in foreign (domestic) capital markets remains restricted by regulation but becomes more open over time.
- Governments at different levels play a significant role in the allocation of financial resources.
- Strong on quantity but week on quality.

Evidence on Capital Misallocation
- Source of financing by firm ownership types (Allen, Qian, and Qian, 2005; Dollar and Wei, 2007)
- Marginal returns to capital across firm ownership (Dollar and Wei, 2007)
- Marginal returns to capital across regions (Dollar and Wei, 2007)
Conlusion:
- Even after many years of reforms, state-owned firms still have significantly lower returns to capital, on average, than domestic private or foreign-owned firms.
- Similarly, uneven marginal returns to capital across regions suggest a low degree of financial integration within China. Certain regions have consistently lower returns to capital than other regions.

**Marginal Revenue Product**
Marginal revenue product (MRP), also known as the marginal value product, is the marginal revenue created due to an addition of one unit of resource.

Evidence on Capital Misallocation: Conclusions
- Even after many years of reforms, state-owned firms still have significantly lower returns to capital, on average, than domestic private or foreign-owned firms.
- Similarly, uneven marginal returns to capital across regions suggest a low degree of financial integration within China. Certain regions have consistently lower returns to capital than other regions.

We did not allocate capital to companies that are more productive.

## Financial System in Transition
Since the government does not have sufficient fiscal resources to subsidize the SOEs, it turned to the financial system by depressing banks’ deposit and lending rates and also by influencing banks’ credit allocation in favor of the SOEs.
As a result, although the proportion of the SOEs declined steadily, the macroeconomic conditions deteriorated in the 1990s, a period when the state sector as a whole made net losses, the fiscal system nearly collapsed, and the banks’ average bad loan ratio skyrocketed.

Today, the entire economy moves rapidly toward the market system, but some nonmarket behavior continues to prevail.
For instance, the SOEs are probability still enjoying favorable interest rates than the private firms. Likewise, the local government finance vehicles (LGFVs), which borrowed massively from the banks and the markets after the recession of 2008, also enjoy certain degrees of government guarantees.

At the core of this program were dramatic institutional reforms in four core areas of the economy: 
1. the fiscal and tax system, 
	1. Fiscal reforms in 1994 were designed to transition to a broader tax base by implementing a 17% value-added tax (VAT) and other business taxes. The strong performance of tax revenues after the reform showed that broadening the tax base was successful. 
	2. Fiscal reforms also designed to put fiscal relations of the central and local governments on a sounder and more stable basis. This was done by increasing the total taxes collected by the center and establishing a set of rules for sharing revenues between central and local governments.
2. the banking and financial system, 
	1. Banking and Financial System. The People’s Bank of China (PBC) was given a formal charter in 1995 that made it responsible for monetary policy, under the guidance of the State Council.
	2. The PBC was given a workable organizational structure in 1998, setting up 9 regional branches along the lines of the Fed. With its new mandate to conduct monetary policy and with a monetary policy board established as a governance and advisory body, the PBC began to play an active role in monetary policy making.
	3. In 2003, the PBC supervisory function were spun off to(被拆分到) the newly created China Bank Regulatory Commission.
3. ownership and corporate governance, and 
	1. Corporate Governance. A large-scale effort to restructure the state-owned corporate sector was begun with the adoption of the Company Law on July 1, 1994.
	2. The Law provided for all SOEs to gradually reorganize as limited-liability corporations, with clarified corporate governance institutions.
	3. Systematic restructing of corporate governance was combined with selective listing of SOEs on China’s newly opened stock markets, which grew significantly during the late 1990s.
	4. Together, these measures changed the structure of China’s large SOEs and created a demand for new types of financial regulation. With the implementation of the Securities Law in July 1999, the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s branches became operational nationwide, forming a centralized network of securities supervisors.
4. the external sector.
	1. External Sector: Opening Capped by Entry into the WTO. Extraordinary steps were taken to open the economy in 1993. Foreign firms were allowed access to China’s market through FDI, touching off a surge of incoming investment.
	2. At the end of 1993, reforms unified China’s foreign exchange regime (eliminating the dual track in foreign exchange), devalued the currency, and established current-account convertibility


## Appendix-Background on China’s Gradualist “Dual-Track” Reform Approach
Reforms in general are intrinsically difficult to carry out for both economic and political reasons.

Reformers gradually lowered barriers and opened up their system; they gave individuals and groups the opportunity to act entrepreneurially and meet market demands. Early reforms created pockets to grow because they were seen as contributing to developmental objectives.

## A simple Model of Bank Runs
### Setup
- There are three periods $𝑇 = 0,1,2$ 
- There is an investment opportunity  
- If you invest one unit at $𝑇 = 0$, then you get $𝑟_2 > 1$ if you wait till $𝑇 = 2$ 
- But if you pull out at $𝑇 = 1$, then you get $𝑟_1 < 𝑟_2$ 
- Illiquid asset: low value of $𝑟_1/𝑟_2$ , the higher the ratio, the more liquid the asset is
- Two types of investors 
- Impatient type: can only consume at $𝑇 = 1$ 
- Patient type: can only consume at $𝑇 = 2$

### Expected utility
The expected utility you will get is then
$$0.75\times(1-\frac{1}{c_2})+0.25\times (1-\frac{1}{c_1})$$
If you invest in the project, you have
$$0.75\times(1-\frac{1}{r_2})+0.25\times(1-\frac{1}{r_1})$$

### Liquidity is good
Asset 1: $𝑟_1 = 1, 𝑟_2 = 2, \frac{𝑟_1}{𝑟_2} = 0.5$ 
Asset 2: $𝑟_1 = 1.28, 𝑟_2 = 1.813, \frac{𝑟_1}{𝑟_2} = 0.706$
You can show that the second asset which is more liquid gives more expected utility
$$\begin{align}
0.75\times(1-\frac{1}{2})+0.25\times(1-\frac{1}{1})=0.375\\
0.75\times(1-\frac{1}{1.813})+0.25\times(1-\frac{1}{1.28})=0.375
\end{align}$$

# The Banking Industry and Shadow Banking 
The banking industry owns more than 95% of the financial system’s total assets.
![Pasted image 20231128120822](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341226.png)
![Pasted image 20231128120905](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341227.png)
The scale of the banking industry far exceeds the total financing of the bond and the stock markets.
In 2002, the loans by banks accounted for more than 90% of the flow of Aggregate Financing to the Real Economy (AFRE 社会融资规模). In 2018, it still accounted for 65% of the flow of AFRE.

At the end of 2017, China’s banking industry consisted of 4,532 banking institutions with licenses.
These institutions include the big 5, 3 policy banks, 12 joint-stock commercial banks, 134 city commercial banks, 17 private banks, 965 rural area financial institutions, 1,262 rural cooperative banks, and a number of foreign subsidiary banks, assets management companies, money brokerage companies, and trust companies.
![Pasted image 20231128121706](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341228.png)

The big 5 are **majority-owned** by the central government and focus on traditional financial intermediation between savers and borrowers.
At the end of 2016, domestic deposits were the main funding source and accounted for around 80% of their total liabilities. At the same time, loans accounted for 60% of their total assets.
The big 5 have similar business models.
![Pasted image 20231128121830](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341229.png)

In 1994, 3 policy banks—the China Development Bank (CDB), the Export-Import Bank of China (CEXIM), and the Agriculture Development Bank of China (ADBC)—were established in an effort to separate policy-related lending from commercial lending.
Policy banks are **wholly state-owned** and are under the direct leadership of the State Council. Each has a distinct mission.
ADBC’s main task is to support farmers and the development of agriculture and rural areas in accordance with the national strategy.
The CEXIM provides financial services to promote China’s exports, particularly high-tech and new-tech products, and to facilitate the import of technologically advanced machinery and equipment.
In 2015, the State Council explicitly positioned the CDB as a development finance institution. It mainly provides strategic support for important medium-to long-term national economic initiatives by providing medium-to long-term financing.

Joint-Stock Commercial Banks
Joint-stock banks are held by corporations, including non-state entities. For example, the China Minsheng Bank is the first commercial bank in mainland China founded by private capital.
The banks included are the Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (SPD), China Citic Bank (CITIC), China Everbright Bank (CEB), China Guangfa Bank (CGB), Industrial Bank (CIB), Huaxia Bank (HXB), China Merchants Bank (CMB), China Minsheng Bank (CMBC), Ping An Bank (PAB), and China Zheshang Bank (CZB).
![Pasted image 20231128130935](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341230.png)

Other Commericial Banks
The China Banking Regulatory Commission started a pilot program in 2014 to allow private capital to found banks.
Private banks have a variety of business models, including small deposits and small loans (e.g., Ali Loan by Alibaba) and large deposits and small loans (e.g., WeBank by Tencent).

**City commercial banks** used to be wholly owned by local governments, but during the 2000s the banks were transformed into joint-stock banks in which the local governments became the main shareholders.
Due to regulations, the establishment of branches of city commercial banks outside of the home city is restricted. Therefore, **they have much fewer branches than joint-stock commercial banks.**

**Rural Area Financial Institutions**: Examples of rural area financial institutions are rural credit cooperatives, village and township banks, rural commercial banks, and rural cooperative banks.
In general, they provide services only to rural populations. Private capital accounts for 90% of the total capital in rural cooperatives and 70% of the capital in rural banks.

**Foreign Banks**: With the gradual outward development of China’s economy, its banking industry has accelerated its opening-up policy in an effort to further promote the reform of the banking industry.
Foreign banks typically focus on foreign companies as their main customers, and their market share in China’s banking system remains very low, consistently below 3%.

## Bank Reform
### The First Round
In the late 1990s, as a result of the Asian financial crisis and management problems within the Chinese banks, substantial nonperforming loans accumulated in China’s banking system, preventing the banks from making new loans.
The Chinese government urgently needed both to recapitalize the state-owned banks and to lower the amount of the nonperforming loans.

The Chinese government created a new scheme that distinguished “good” banks from “bad” ones. By carving out the nonperforming assets from “good banks” and concentrating the bad assets in “bad banks,” the Chinese government ensured that the “good banks” could operate normally.
In 1998, the National People’s Congress adopted a capital injection plan for the Big 4 Banks. The PBC lowered its reserve requirement ratio from 13% to 8%. The Big 4 used the released capital to buy RMB 270 billion special treasury bonds issued by the MOF, and the MOF injected the money back into the banks as capital.

Meanwhile, 4 asset management corporations, the China Great Wall, China Cinda, China Huarong, and China Orient, were created to absorb the bad assets.
Since 2001, China’s regulators have gradually lowered the business tax of commercial banks.
The first round of reforms was mainly technical, as, for example, handling the nonperforming assets, enhancing internal management, and dealing with other matters, without addressing the in-depth systematic and mechanical issues.

### The Second Round
The 2nd round of reforms, which occurred between 2003 and 2010, was implemented in response to the reoccurrence of a large amount of nonperforming assets in the banking system.
One reason for this reoccurrence was that the corporate governance structure had not been thoroughly reformed, so bad loans were continuously being created by banks after the first round of reform.
Another reason was that during the first round of reform, some banks did not fully report their real situation to the government.

This round took the experience of the first round into consideration—so that, in addition to capital injections, **improving the corporate governance structure** was a major objective of the round.
The government **used foreign exchange reserves** of the PBC for capital injection in the second round.
At the end of 2003, the central government **chose the BOC and the CCB as the pilot banks** for the new shareholding system. Through the newly established Central Huijin Investment Co., US $45 billion of China’s foreign exchange reserve was injected into the two banks so that they could begin a new round of reform, along with starting the public listing process.

This round of reforms occurred in **4 stages**: 
1) financial restructuring and capital injection; 
2) establishing joint stock companies; 
3) introducing strategic investors; and 
4) launching IPOs.
Collectively, these reforms **fundamentally strengthened the financial condition of the banking sector**.
The internal control mechanism and risk management capability were also improved.
At the international level, the sector’s market position and international competitiveness were also improved significantly.

NPL: nonperforming loan
RHS: right hand side

### Recent Progress
In July 2015, US $48 billion and US $45 billion worth of foreign exchange reserves were injected into the CDB and the CEXIM, respectively, significantly improving their capital strength and risk control capability.
Capital injection, along with the introduction of capital adequacy ratio requirements, has enhanced the capital restraint on policy banks.
In 2015, the Postal Savings Bank (PSB) successfully attracted 10 domestic and foreign strategic investors, moving from a single shareholder to equity diversification. It was then listed on H shares in 2016 and on the domestic A-share market in 2019.
In sum, the reform of China’s commercial banks has made significant progress.
**Improving corporate governance, enhancing risk control capabilities, and elevating overall competitiveness continue to be the principal goals.**

## Shadow Banking
In recent years, China’s shadow banking system has become an integral part of the financial system.
A key characteristic of shadow banking in China is that **banks hide loans as alternative accounting subjects.**

Chinese shadow banking can be divided into **two categories: banks’ shadow and traditional shadow banking**.
Both provide funding under the general shadow banking system, but **only banks’ shadow affects money supply.**
The term “banks’ shadow” refers to bank activities that provide funding for enterprises through the creation of credit money, but that **circumvent regulatory restrictions and constraints on loan granting by adopting nonstandard accounting bookkeeping.**

Banks’ shadow is inherently **identical to bank loans** in the sense that it creates credit to fulfill the funding need of the real economy while expanding assets and creating money.
However, it **differs from bank loans in the sense that it is not listed as a loan in balance sheet items.**
Banks’ shadow is **mainly channeled through a third-party financial institution**. Therefore, it exists in terms of **interbank assets** (on the asset side of the bank balance sheet), **investment assets**, or **off-balance sheet items** (e.g., off-balance sheet wealth management products, or **WMPs**).

The model of traditional shadow banking is mainly through **nonbank financial institutions** (e.g., trust companies, securities companies, finance companies, financial leasing companies, and microcredit companies), which transfer funds that are raised to the real economy borrowers (not a channel for banks) through trust loans, asset management plans, equipment leasing, mortgages, and credit loans.
In this process, nonbank financial institutions act as **credit intermediaries**. The credit scale increases, but **the quantity of money** is unchanged, as credit is created by adjusting the distribution of money (i.e., money is transferred from investors to financiers).

Innovations of shadow banking activities in China stem from the bank-dominant financial system and its feature of **regulatory constraints**.
Shadow banking in China _generates more shadow_ as a result of the binding capital adequacy requirements of commercial banks. Those **additional credits were allocated to industries in which the government restricts the credit supply from banks**.

### Evolution of Shadow Banking in China
1. During the first stage (Jan. 2006 to Oct. 2011), the scale of banks’ shadow and its proportion in money creation were both stable.
2. During the second stage (Oct.2011 to Jan. 2017), both the scale of banks’ shadow and its proportion in money creation increased.
3. During the third stage (from Jan.2017 and after), the scale of banks’ shadow became stable while its proportion of money creation began to decrease.
![Pasted image 20231128153719](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341234.png)

In the 2nd quarter of 2010, the monetary authorities began to implement **prudent monetary policies**, introduced macro-prudential policies characterized by capital constraints to strengthen regulations, and applied specific credit regulations to sectors with excess capacity (e.g., real estate).
To **circumvent the preceding regulations and capital restrictions**, banks converted loan assets to banks’ shadow through such tools as investment and interbank businesses, to meet the rigid financing needs of real estate developers and local government financing platforms.

China has **tightened financial regulations since January 2017**, when off-balance sheet products, such as trust and entrusted loans, were included in the Macro-Prudential Assessment (MPA) and local governments were prohibited from continuously expanding their debt.

Compared to banks’ shadow, China’s traditional shadow banking is relatively small.
Before 2010, traditional shadow banking developed slowly, with a scale of less than RMB2 trillion, taking less than 2% of the total credit created by banks.
Since 2010, the scale of traditional shadow banking has grown, whereas nonbank financial institutions played an important role in credit creation and meeting social financing needs.

Trust assets take the largest share of traditional shadow banking, and its contraction led to a sharp drop in the scale of traditional shadow banking in 2017.
This contraction was a result of stricter regulations (e.g., capital requirements) on trust companies imposed by Chinese regulators.
![Pasted image 20231128165805](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341235.png)

### Funding Flows of Shaow Banking
Funding from China’s shadow banking mainly flows into **3 types of borrowers: local government financing vehicles (LGFVs), enterprises with excess capacity, and real estate developers**.
Commercial banks typically require shadow banking borrowers to provide collaterals as loan borrowers and also to bear **higher interest rates** than loans. That is how these 3 types of borrowers come into play. **They usually have land inventories as collaterals and have the ability to transfer or take higher interest rates themselves**.

But **these two things are what SMEs and private companies (non–real estate) lack**, which makes them difficult to obtain shadow bank funding as well.
A typical funding flow of China’s shadow banking: **State banks lend to nonbanking financial institutions, which then lend as entrusted loans to LGFVs, enterprises with overcapacity, and real estate developers**.

**Trust companies** are the main carriers of shadow fund flows.
In China, the trust company license allows participation in money market business, capital market business, and alternative investments.
Trust companies **can lend to restricted or high-risk industries** (e.g., real estate, LGFVs) **and are subject to less scrutiny**, as they only act on behalf of their beneficiaries.

### Risks Associated with Shadow Banking
First, it **raises risk exposures**. The **corporate credit-to- GDP ratio** increased significantly. The **total exposure to real estate sector** also increases, including direct investment exposure and exposure through collateral; and the **risk exposure of local governments** also increases due to LGFVs, which are an important source of credit.
Second, an **unreliable supply of funds** enhances financial risk.
	Maturity mismatch and rollover risk are critical issues in the Chinese shadow banking system. Most funding from shadow banking is short term and must be rolled over constantly.
Third, the shadow banking system **may induce large-scale loan defaults**. Despite the lack of any explicit guarantee, Chinese investors typically expect banks or the government to cover any losses. Once this trust is shaken, investors may not only panic and run on the shadow banking sector, but also further trigger systemic risk.
Fourth, the shadow banking system **increases systematic risks**. Compared with traditional banks, the shadow banking system is less transparent and less regulated, though it carries a high liquidity risk. Shadow banking threatens the stability of the entire financial system.

### Monetary Policy Challenges
**Strict regulation of traditional banking is an important reason behind the growth of China’s shadow banking system**.
In the 2nd quarter of 2010, Chinese monetary authorities began to implement prudent monetary policy, introduced macro-prudential policies characterized by capital constraints to strengthen regulation, and applied specific credit regulations to sectors with excess capacity.
To circumvent regulations and meet the financing need in certain sectors, shadow banking activities rose sharply.

Conversely, shadow banking **demolishes the effects of monetary policies**. The effectiveness of some regulatory policies has been compromised or partially offset by shadow banking activities.
For example, despite government’s credit limits on the real estate sector or enterprises with excess capacity, shadow banking provides alternative funding resources.
Furthermore, the **capital adequacy requirement for banks became less effective**, as shadow banking activities enabled banks to move some assets off-balance sheet.

### Recent Regulations on Shadow Banking
The main regulator of Chinese shadow banking is the **China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission** (CBIRC).
**Since 2017, China has tightened financial regulations** in several ways. First, the MPA has been erected; all off-balance sheet products, such as trust and entrusted loans, must be included in the MPA.
Second, limitations on the scale of WMPs have been set; banks are forbidden from providing principal or interest guarantees on WMPs and must set separate accounts for each product.
Third, the central government has prohibited local governments from continuously expanding their debt.
Fourth, within the background of supply-side structural reform, funding support to enterprises with excess capacity and to real estate companies is still limited, with the limitations now expanding from loans to other financial products.
Those regulations have **slowed down the growth of the shadow banking sector.**

# The Stock Market 
The One-Period Valuation Model:
$P_0=\frac{Fiv_1}{(1+k_e)}+\frac{P_1}{(1+k_e)}$
$P_0=$ the current price of the stock
$Div_1=$ the dividend paid at the end of year 1
$k_e=$ the required return on investment in equity
$P_1=$ the sale price of the stock at the end of the first period

The Generalized Dividend Valuation Model:
The value of stock today is the present value of all future cash flows
$P_0=\frac{D_1}{(1+k_e)^1}+\frac{D_2}{(1+k_e)^2}+\dots+\frac{D_n}{(1+k_e)^n}+\frac{P_n}{(1+k_e)^n}$
If $P_0$ is fair in the future, it will not affect $P_0$
$P_0=\sum\limits_{t=1}^\infty \frac{D_t}{(1+k_e)^t}$
The price of the stock is determined only by the present value of the future dividend stream

The Gordon Growth Model:
$P_0=\frac{D_0(1+g)}{(k_e-g)}=\frac{D_1}{(k_e-g)}$
$D_0=$ the most recent dividend paid
$g=$ the expected constant growth rate in dividends
$k_e=$ the required return on an investment in equity
Dividends are assumed to continue growing at a constant rate forever
The growth rate is assumed to be less than the required return on equity

Application: Monetary Policy and Stock Prices
Monetary policy can affect stock prices in 2 ways. First, when a central bank lowers interest rates, the return on bonds (an alternative asset) declines, and investors are likely to accept a lower required rate of return on an investment in equity. The resulting decline lowers the denominator in the Gordon growth model and raises stock prices.
Furthermore, a lowering of interest rates is likely to stimulate the economy, so the growth rate in dividends, g, is likely to be somewhat higher. This rise in g also leads to a rise in stock prices.

The Thepry of Rational Expectations
Adaptive expectations:
- Expectations are formed from past experience only.
- Changes in expectations will occur slowly over time as data changes.

However, people use more than just past data to form their expectations and sometimes change their expectations quickly.
Rational expectations is an economic theory that states that individuals make decisions based on the best available information.

Rational Expectations will be identical to optimal forecasts using all available information.
Even though a rational expectation equals the optimal forecast using all available information, a prediction based on it may not always be perfectly accurate.
- It takes too much effort to make their expectation the best guess possible.
- The best guess will not be accurate because the predictor is unaware of some relevant information.•Rational Expectations will be identical to optimal forecasts using all available information.

$$X^e=X^{of}$$
$X^e=$ expecttion of the variable that is being forcast
$X^{of}=$ optimal forecast using all available information

In an efficient market, a security’s price fully reflects all available information.
$$\begin{align}
R^{of}>R^*\Rightarrow P_t \uparrow \Rightarrow R^{of}\downarrow\\
R^{of}<R^*\Rightarrow P_t \downarrow \Rightarrow R^{of}\uparrow
\end{align}$$
until 
$$R^{of}=R^*$$
In an efficient market, all unexploited profit opportunities will be eliminated

## Evolution of the A Share Listed Firms
A greater number of **larger firms and state-owned enterprises** (SOEs) have been listed on the SSE as compared to the SZSE.

As of the end of 2018, the total market capitalization of the two exchanges stood at $6.3 trillion, the second largest stock market in the world.

Four types of products are traded in the exchanges: stocks, fixed-income securities/bonds, funds, and derivatives.
- Fixed-income securities include publicly issued bonds, privately placed bonds, and asset-backed securities, among others.
- Funds include exchange-traded funds (ETFs), listed open-ended funds (LOFs), structured funds, and closed-end funds.
- Only a small number of financial derivatives are traded in the A-share market.

The Chinese stock market issues two types of stocks: _A-share and B-share stocks_. The A-share stocks are _denominated in RMB and issued to domestic investors_ (also to qualified foreign institutional investors, QFII).

B-share stocks are **quoted in U.S. or HK dollars and issued to offshore investors**. They became **available to domestic investors with foreign currency accounts in 2001**.

In 2018, the total market capitalizations for A shares and B shares were RMB 32.0 trillion and 87.2 billion, and those for traded A shares and B shares were RMB 27.2 trillion and 87.2 billion, respectively.  The **B-share market thus accounts for only 0.27% of the entire A-share market**.

While the A-share market is still **dominated by retail investors** in terms of trading, **institutional** investors have increased their presence in it over the past few years.
The percentage of SSE’s market cap held by retail investors has been declining over the years, and it was about **21%** at the end of 2017, while (domestic) institutional investors’ holdings made up over three-quarters of the total market capitalization.

The number of listed firms in mainland China has grown rapidly since the market’s inception. There were only **10** publicly listed firms in mainland China in 1990, 8 of which were listed in SSE and 2 in SZSE; the total market cap was RMB 104.8 billion measured as of 1992.
By the end of 2018, the number of listed firms in the two exchanges reached **3,584**. The total market capitalization increased to RMB 43.5 trillion measured as of the end of 2018, an increase of **415 times** relative to the level of 1992.

During most of the 1990s, the stock market was **dominated by SOEs** and collectively owned firms.
As more privately owned firms entered the stock market, the percentage of listed **SOEs declined** over the years, from 56.4% in 2000 **to 37.9% in 2014**.

Both SSE and SZSE are nonprofit organizations regulated by the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
The Security Laws, which regulate the issuance and trading of stocks in China, were passed by the National People’s Congress in 1998.

## Institutional Features of the Market
### Initial Public Offering
The IPO mechanism in China is administration-based—that is, a firm’s IPO must be approved by the regulatory authority CSRC.

The CSRC sets a series of requirements on the listing firm’s information disclosure, operation, accounting quality, and usage of proceeds raised from stock issuance. In particular, **the issuing firm must clear high hurdles on earnings and cash flows.**

The CSRC has been contemplating reforming the IPO mechanism, from the current administration-based process to a registration/market-based process.

Why need selection of list?
CSRC want to protect investors.

Under the new IPO mechanism, especially with the accounting and financial performance hurdles removed, observers would expect more firms from new and growth industries but without current steady cash flows to conduct IPOs.

At the same time, investors **will have to expend more efforts in evaluating the quality and prospects of IPOs**, rather than relying on the regulators’ approval as quality assurance.

Reforming the IPO process has been proven to be a complex and challenging task.

The CSRC announced in early 2019 that the SSE would initiate a pilot program using a “**registration system**” to select and list firms from a set of technology and new industries.

This pilot “Science and Technology Innovation Board” (the SSE STAR Market) was launched in June 2019.

The registration system was **formally extended to all segments of the A-share market on Feb. 17, 2023**.
### The Delisting Process
The “special treatment” (ST) process was introduced to the Chinese A-share market in 1998.
Firms that experience losses for 2 consecutive years would receive the ST status.
Firms that experience losses for 3 consecutive years would receive warnings for delisting, and the trading of their stocks would be suspended.
A firm can have its ST status removed if it has improved its performance and met a set of requirements.

A stock delisting can be voluntary or involuntary.
- A voluntary delisting can result from a listed firm’s being privatized. When such a firm is acquired or merged into a new company, the firm applies for a voluntary delisting from the exchange.
- An involuntary delisting usually happens when the firm violates regulations or cannot meet the minimum financial requirements set by the exchange.

The CSRC specifies that a firm’s listing status would be suspended if the firm experiences negative earnings in 3 consecutive years; more severely, it would be delisted if the loss continues in the subsequent 6 months.
On March 21, 2016, ST Boyuan was delisted, and it was the first case of forced delisting owing to repeated violations of regulations as well as fraudulent behavior, including misreporting earnings.

However, firms are **rarely delisted** in the A-share market.
Only about 20 stocks (or 1%) were delisted from the market every year over the period 2000–2014, and fewer than 10 were delisted because of poor performance.
These percentages are far below those in other large markets. For example, from 2000 to 2014, the average percentages of delisted firms in the U.S. and Brazil were 33% and 13%, respectively.

Firms that cannot meet the IPO standards may seek opportunities for “**backdoor listings**” through asset injection into or restructuring ST firms, which give rise to related-party transactions and other forms of “rent-seeking” behavior.
To improve the efficiency of the delisting process, CSRC published “Opinions on reforming, improving and strictly implementing delisting of listed firms” on October 14, 2014.

Conceivably, more firms would be delisted from the exchanges when the delisting mechanisms become better enforced.
With more efficient delisting mechanisms, it would be more difficult and costly to speculate on the “shell” value of ST firms or to seek backdoor listings, thus mitigating the widespread rent-seeking problem related to ST firms in the A-share market.

### Trading Mechanisms and Regulations
The Chinese stock market implements in the A-share market the so-called **T+1 trading rule**, which forbids investors from selling the stock on the same day as they buy it.
Instead, they can start selling the stock they purchased on “day T” from day T+1 and onward.
The purpose of implementing the T+1 trading rule is **to reduce speculative trading** and stabilize the stock market.

Both exchanges set **daily price change limits to be 10%**, meaning that the maximum price change within one trading day cannot exceed the range –10% to +10% of the closing price in the prior trading day.
The trading rules specify the circumstances in which the price change limit does not apply—for instance, on the first trading day of an IPO of a stock or closed-end fund, or on the first trading day when a stock’s trading is resumed after trading suspension.

The stock exchanges have issued **a series of rules and regulations to prohibit insider trading**.
Two major rules are **trading suspension and trading account lockup**.
Specifically, the stock exchange has the right to suspend stock trading when stock prices or trading behavior are detected to be “abnormal.”
A typical case that can trigger suspension is when the three-day cumulative price increase or decrease reaches +20% or –20%.

For instance, a stock account would be locked up if it buys more than 500K shares that are on the warning board (such as ST stocks), or if it submits a larger amount of buying or selling orders without a trading purpose.
**Market manipulation is also prohibited**. The stock exchange would lock up or put restrictions on a trading account of a securities firm if the account is found to trade against its publicly recommended security analysis or security trading strategy. Rules also prohibit producing or spreading fraudulent information that can influence security prices or mislead other investors.

### Stocks Listed and Traded on Various Boards
The A-share market is composed of the Main-board Market (主板市场), Second-board Market (二板市场), and Third-board Market (三板市场).
The Main-board is also named First-board Market, which is the primary market for stock trading with strict listing requirements as discussed above.
Established in 2009, the Second-board Market of the SZSE is also named the **Growth Enterprise Market** (GEM) in China, similar to Nasdaq in the US. The main rationale for establishing this market is to provide additional opportunities for small and growth firms to publicly issue stocks.

There is another tier in the A-share market, the so-called the Small-and-Medium Enterprise (SME) Board.
It was launched in 2004 as a subordination to the SZSE. Stocks with market capitalization of traded shares less than RMB 100 million can choose to be listed in the SME Board.

The Third-board Market was established in 2001 as an alternative trading venue for both firms unqualified to be listed in the main board and those delisted from it.
The old Third-board Market was an over-the-counter market dominated by low-quality stocks with little liquidity.
In 2006, a new shares transfer system was set up in the Zhongguancun Science Park in Beijing, named the “New Third-board Market (新三板)” or “New over-the-counter Market.”

As an important step to integrate the A-share market with global markets, CSRC and the Securities and Futures Commission in Hong Kong launched the **Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect Program** on November 17, 2014.
This program allows investors in Shanghai to trade stocks listed in the Hong Kong Exchange (HKEX, southbound trades), and allows investors in Hong Kong to trade those in the SSE (northbound trades).
The Shenzhen–Hong Kong Connect Program was launched on **December 5, 2016**. Different from the Shanghai–Hong Kong Connect, which covers large-capitalized stocks, the Shenzhen–Hong Kong Connect Program covers smaller stocks.

### Oversea Listing
Compared with the A-share market, the accounting and financial requirements for listing are lower at the HKEX. 
The listing standards set by the Growth Enterprises Market (GEM) Board are even lower.
The high, **performance-based listing hurdles in the A-share** market partly explain why some large Chinese tech firms’ chose to list in external markets: examples include Alibaba (NYSE), Tencent (HKSE), and Baidu (Nasdaq).

Many other Chinese firms seek listing in Hong Kong and other overseas markets to **raise funds globally and to avoid the stringent listing requirements in the A-share market**.
According to statistics released by the HKEX, as of May 2018 there were 1,076 firms from mainland China listed in Hong Kong: 254 were “H shares” (SOEs headquartered in mainland China), and 164 were “Red Chip” stocks (Chinese SOEs established in Hong Kong), and 658 were private enterprises.

## Summary of Performance
Performance can be summarized as four highs and one low: high turnover, high volatility, high P/E ratio, high synchronicity(千股涨停，千股跌停), and low return.
### High Turnover
The Chinese market is dominated by individual investors and is characterized by **high turnover ratios**.
In 2017, SSE and SZSE exhibited turnover ratios of 161.60% and 264.54%, respectively, far exceeding those of other large stock exchanges.
![Pasted image 20231130164959](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341236.png)

### High Volatility
For the period 2000–2017, the average annual return volatility  was 29% for the A-share market, approximately two times that of the U.S. market.
For most of the years, the return volatilities in the A-share market were also higher than those in other developed markets like Japan’s, and higher than other large emerging markets like India’s.

### High PE ratio
The price earnings (P/E) ratio has mostly been significantly higher in China than in the U.S.
Several factors may contribute to the valuation differentials, including foreign capital access, retail investors’ speculative motives, state ownership, and financial development.
![Pasted image 20231130165321](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341237.png)

### High Synchronicity
Like other emerging markets, stocks listed in the A-share market also demonstrate high synchronicity.
One study finds that 80% of the stocks in the A-share market often move in the same direction in a given week.
The stock price synchronicity is not a result of co-movement in firm fundamentals, but rather is explained by speculation of government intervention policies or “noise trading”.

### Low Return
The cumulative SSE index return over the period 1992–2018 is substantially lower than that of other emerging countries like Brazil and India, and also lower than that of the US.
The SSE index only outperformed Japan’s Nikkei index.
The correlation between the 5-year stock returns and future GDP growth for the A share market is –1.3% with a p-value of 0.637, It is, however, positive and significant in other economies. It is also positive and significant for oversea listed Chinese firms.

## Reasons for Underperformance
High listing standards lead to financial packaging incentives in the pre-IPO period and adverse selection
	The IPO process can be problematic in twofold. First, the IPO selection process result in adverse selection. Firms with worse performance potential are selected to be listed.
	![Pasted image 20231130170339](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341240.png)
	Operating Performance of Listed Firms and Matched Unlisted Firms in China (Allen et al., 2019)
	![Pasted image 20231130170359](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341241.png)
	Second, the IPO process adversely affects firms’ incentives, which may lead to firms’ deteriorating performance after IPO. Even if good firms are selected to be listed, the stock performance can become poor if their operating performance becomes worse after IPO.
	Next table (from Allen et al., 2019) shows the international comparison of changes in operating performance around IPO for the listed firms in China and in other markets.
	The dependent variables are the changes in ROA, ROE and ROS in years around IPO.
	Panel A demonstrates that compared with firms listed in other large countries (US, India, Brazil and Japan). Panel B compares the same operating performance measures for Chinese firms listed in A-share and Chinese firms listed in overseas stock markets.
	![Pasted image 20231130170722](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341242.png)
	![Pasted image 20231130170731](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341243.png)
	The third problem is window dressing before IPO.
	To meet the listing criteria, Chinese firms may exploit all resources before IPO to generate high profits. As long as the firm becomes listed, all growth opportunities have been used up and performance starts to deteriorate.
The inefficient delisting process
	The figure in the next slide (from Allen et al., 2019) compare firms that received special treatment (“ST”) in China and firms delisted in US due to reasons that are similar for Chinese firms to receive ST.
	The two groups of firms see similar level of ROA from year -2 to the delisting year. Put differently, if listed in the US, these “ST” firms should have been delisted from the exchange.
	![Pasted image 20231130182956](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341244.png)
Low firm investment returns
	Although firms listed in A-share have lower performance than firms listed in other countries, they are still making positive earnings.
	The next question is why the positive earnings are not accumulated to generate higher valuation for firms.
	One possible explanation is that firms make larger but inefficient investment, which consumes their earnings and leads to zero or negative cash flows.
		Evidence:
		The next figure (from Allen et al., 2019) compares investment size and net cash flows of firms listed in China and other large countries, and Chinese firms listed overseas by calendar year.
		Panel A1 shows, firms listed in A-share see a higher capital expenditure-to-total assets ratio (around 8%) than firms listed in other countries for most of the years (around 2-4%).
		Panel A2 shows that firms listed in A-share also invest consistently more than Chinese firms listed overseas. If the investment is an efficient one, then larger investment should generate more net cash flows (at least positive cash flows) in the long run.
		![Pasted image 20231130183353](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341245.png)
		![Pasted image 20231130183401](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341246.png)
		Panel B compares the value-weighted average net cash flows generated by A-share firms and firms listed in other countries from 2000 to 2014, with the year-end book assets as the weight.
		As Panel B1 shows, A-share firms generate lower net cash flows than listed firms in other emerging countries like India and Brazil in most of the years.
		Panel B2 shows that A-share firms also generate lower net cash flows than Chinese firms listed in oversea markets.

Weak corporate governance and tunneling
	Tunneling （隧道效应，大股东掏空上市公司）is financial fraud committed by the transfer of assets and profits out of firms for the benefit of those who control them.
	The table in the next slide (Allen et al., 2019) measures tunneling activities by the direction and amount of related-party transactions (RPTs).
	It then regresses firms’ investment and cash flows on the lagged (by one year) RPT variables.
	While (lagged) net RPT outflow does not affect the scale of investment, it is negatively associated with firms’ operating and net cash flows in the next period (Columns 4 to 6).

## Crises and Further  Reforms
### The Two Crashes
From mid-2007 to 2008, the SSE index rose from 3,821 to over 6,124 as of October 16, 2007, then clipped off and bottomed at 1,664 in 2008.
The other market crash in the A-share market occurred in June 2015. From mid-June to early July of that year, the SSE index plunged by 32%.
![Pasted image 20231130192543](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341251.png)
One widely accepted reason for China’s stock market crash in 2007 is that stock prices deviated too much from fundamentals.
Indeed, the market index increased by 80% from the beginning of 2007 to April 2007. The average P/E of A-share stocks was 35, or roughly double that of the U.S. market.
Loose monetary policy in the period 2005–2007 provided sufficient liquidity to the market and resulted in credit expansion, allowing firms to invest more. Meanwhile, the low interest rate environment shifted money flow from the debt market to the stock market.
#### The 2015 Market Crash: 1st round
From June 15 to July 3, the SSE Index, the Shenzhen Component Index, and the GEM Board Index dropped by 28.64%, 32.34%, and 33.19%, respectively.
On July 4, the State Council called together the PBC, CSRC, China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC), China Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC), Ministry of Finance, and officials of large SOEs to discuss possible ways to save the stock market.
On July 5, CSRC announced that the PBC would take a variety of measures to provide liquidity to China Securities and Financial Ltd. (CSF)—the key player in the rescue.
On July 6, more than 1,000 stocks experienced a price run-up at opening but a quick reverse afterward, and the price drop finally hit the limit at closing.
On July 7, the majority of the stocks listed on the GEM Board dropped by 10%, with over 50% of the stocks suspending trading.
The next day, the SSE Index dropped by 5.9%, and 1,300 stocks’ drop hit the limit while more than 1,400 stocks went into trading suspension.
The market then recovered over the coming days. On July 9, the SSE Index recovered by 5.76%, and on July 10, it rose by 4.54%.
#### The 2015 Market Crash: 2nd round
During August 18–26, the SSE Composite Index dropped by 25% to below 3,000 points.
Thus far, the SSE Composite Index had shed 38% of its value from June 12 to August 24.
The second round of rescue started on August 26 and ended on September 25.
The SSE Index finally stabilized at around 3,000 points.

#### Government Interventations in 2015
Starting in late June of 2015, the Chinese government took a series of actions to rescue the stock market.
Starting on June 27, the PBC cut interest rates and trimmed banks’ required reserve ratios.
In early July, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges announced plans to lower securities transaction fees by 30% percent from August.

The CSRC announced relaxation of rules on margin trading, thus lowering the threshold for individual investors to trade on margins and also expanding brokerages’ funding channels.
The CSRC also announced it would set up a team to look into illegal manipulation and investigate cases if needed.
On July 4, China Financial Futures Exchange (CFFEX) suspended 19 accounts from short-selling for one month.

#### The "National Team"
The most notable intervention that occurred was the establishment of a so-called national team that entered the stock market strictly to buy shares.
On July 4, China’s top 21 securities brokerages pledged to invest at least RMB 120 billion (US $19 billion) collectively to help stabilize the market.
They also promised not to sell their own stocks when the SSE Composite Index dipped below 4,500 points.

On the next day, the state-owned investment company China Central Huijin Investment Ltd. said it had recently purchased ETFs to support the market and would continue to do so.
The growing number of state agents, brokerages, and other entities drawn into the market rescue effort were soon dubbed “the national team.”
As a result of the massive state-sponsored rescue effort, the China “national team” owned a total of 6% of the A-share stock market.
China also announced on Aug. 23 that it would allow pension funds managed by local gov. to invest in the stock market for the first time.

#### The Circuit Breaker
On December 4, 2015, the SSE and the SZSE, along with China Financial Futures Exchange, launched a circuit breaker, which restricts a stock’s order price to be within a given range whenever the stock price drop hits a prespecified limit.
The circuit breaker sets two limits, 5% and 7%, on the CSI300 index.
It became effective on January 1, 2016.

An initial purpose of designing the circuit breaker is to stabilize stock prices and protect small investors.
However, it did not work as expected and instead exacerbated the losses and market uncertainty.
This is perhaps not very surprising. Although some studies argue that, when properly designed and implemented, circuit breakers may improve the market’s ability to absorb large volume shocks, others show that the circuit breaker’s own presence can increase the probability of hitting that triggering price.

### What Drove the 2015 Stock Market Crash
**Margin trading and leverage-induced fire sale** are found to be one dominant drive.
Two types of margin accounts, **brokerage-financed and shadow-financed** margin accounts, grew rapidly in early 2015.
While the former allows retail investors to obtain credit from her own brokerage firm (which of course is tightly regulated), the latter falls in a regulatory gray area.

Investors are much more likely to sell assets if the proximity to the Pingcang Line (or forced sale level) is close and when leverage is also high.
Unregulated and highly leveraged shadow-financed brokerage accounts contribute more to the market crash, relative to regulated brokerage accounts.

### Remaining Issues and Future Reforems
1. The Effectiveness of Government Intervention
The national team rescue has both benefits and costs.
On one hand, government intervention during the market crash increased the rescued firms’ value.
On the other hand, the long-run costs are of concern. The massive stock purchases by the government led to price deviation from fundamentals. Its trial-and-error approach may have created more uncertainty in the market, raising market volatility. The rescue may also have created a moral hazard problem on the side of the firms.
2. Shadow Margin Lending and Margin Trading
The 2015 stock market crash featured a substantial amount of margin lending and margin trading.
It is widely believed that excessive leverage taken by unregulated shadow-financed margin accounts and the subsequent fire sales by the deleveraging process were the main driving forces of the Chinese stock market’s collapse.
Better regulations are thus needed.
3. Bank Loans Using Stocks as Collateral
One important product that connects the Chinese stock market and banks is stock pledge loans, as when shareholders of listed firms use stocks as collateral to obtain bank loans. Almost all listed firms in the A-share market have this type of loans.
When stock prices fall below the “Ping Cang Xian”, stocks will undergo forced sales, leading to a further drop in stock prices of the firm and other firms. A further drop in stock prices will result in even more forced sales, leading to a downward spiral.
Forced stock sales also result in more losses by banks in which case the total amount of NPLs(Nonperforming loan) in the banking sector will also rise.

# Investment Funds in China 

## The Development of the Mutual Fund Industry in China
### Deregulations
In November of 1997, the government passed “Interim Measures on the Management of Securities Investment Funds (证券投资基金管理暂行办法),” which legalized the **closed-end** mutual fund business for the first time.
On March 27, 1998, the very first two investment funds, Jintai Fund and Kaiyuan Fund, were issued to the public at 2 billion yuan. Both were closed-end mutual funds solely investing in domestic stocks.

Further in October 2000, “Interim Measures on Open-end Securities Investment Funds (开放式证券投资基金试点办法)” was passed to **allow open-end mutual funds to begin doing business**.
The first open-end fund, Huaan Creative, was then issued in September 2001, with total net assets of 5 billion yuan at inception.
In 2003, legislation in China combined the two interim measures into the Securities Investment Fund Law (中华人民共和国证券投资基金法) and formalized regulations of mutual funds.

### Size
With the passage of Fund Law 2003, the mutual fund industry in China stepped into a fast-growing track.
The number of mutual funds has increased from 46 in 2001 to 4,395 in 2017, while total net assets grew from 58.9 billion to 12.9 trillion yuan, implying an annual growth rate of over 40%.
![Pasted image 20231130194903](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341252.png)
![Pasted image 20231130194911](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341253.png)
While the average growth rate was about 40% per year, the total assets experienced sharp drops in some years.
For example, following the stock market [[Special Topics in Economics#The Two Crashes\|bubble bust in 2007]], the total TNA decreased from 3.2 trillion to 1.9 trillion the next year, owing to large losses and investor redemption.

The fraction of stock market capitalization owned by mutual funds, however, peaked at 7.45% in 2007 and then decreased to 3.21% in 2017. It then started to increase again. In Q1 of 2023, the fraction increased to 11.6%.
![Pasted image 20231130195306](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341254.png)
This is because the total capitalization of the stock market, include both the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges, expanded even faster from about 2 trillion yuan in 2000 to 56.5 trillion in 2017.
By comparison, in the U.S. stock market, mutual fund ownership has stayed at approximately 30% in recent years.
In this sense, Chinese mutual funds can be seen as playing a less influential role in the stock market.

### Fund Management Companies
In 1998, China had a total of three mutual fund companies.
As of 2017, the number of mutual fund companies stood at 119.
Also in 2017, the average size of fund companies increased significantly, from 2 billion yuan in 1998 to 109 billion.

The next figure lists the market share of China’s largest 10 mutual fund companies.
In total, those companies held 57% of the total mutual fund TNA in 2017.
The largest two are China Universal Asset Management Co. (汇添富基金管理股份有限公司), with a 16% market share, and Tianhong Asset Management Co. (天弘基金管理有限公司), with a 13% market share.
![Pasted image 20231130200851](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341255.png)

Over the last 20 years, while dozens of mutual fund companies have entered the market, the larger ones have gained an advantage in competition because of their economy of scale.
The next figure plots the market share of China’s largest 10% of mutual fund companies over the sample years.
It clearly shows that large fund companies own increasingly more market share, from approximately 10% in 2000 to more than 60% in 2017.
![Pasted image 20231130200944](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341256.png)

### Diversity of Fund Products
China’s mutual fund industry began with two closed-end equity funds, but after its 20-year development, the market now offers investors a wide range of fund products for their consideration.
The next figure shows the composition of mutual fund categories in each year.
Before 2003, equity funds made up the majority of the market, but hybrid funds later became the largest in about 2007.
![Pasted image 20231130201105](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341257.png)

In the period 2013 through 2017, money market mutual funds grew rapidly, yet equity funds shrank to less than 10% of the mutual fund market.
Chinese investors apparently benefit from the increased diversity.
For example, fixed income funds give retail investors access to bond markets that an individual can hardly invest in directly. Also, money market funds, because of their larger scale, can negotiate a higher interest rate with banks, which in turn lets fund investors earn higher returns than simple retail bank deposits.

### Extiction of Closed-End Funds
The majority of mutual funds in the Chinese market shift from closed-end to open-end.
In early years, all mutual funds were closed-end. But open-end mutual funds became more popular after they were legalized in 2001.
The next figure plots the total TNA and market share of closed-end funds.
The market share decreased to only 1.5% in 2017. The key reason for this is the illiquidity of closed-end fund shares, making investors less willing to trade and leading to severe discounts for share prices.
![Pasted image 20231130201305](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341258.png)

### Passive Index Funds
![Pasted image 20231130201344](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341259.png)
For equity funds, since 2011 passive funds have become the majority.
As shown in the next figure, at the end of 2017, the total TNA managed by passive funds totaled 519.9 billion yuan, while the number for active funds was 367.9 billion.
Most index funds track the major stock market indices, such as Shanghai 50 and CSI 300.
The largest index fund as of June 2017 was Shanghai 50 Exchanged-traded Index Fund, issued by China Asset Management Co., with total TNA of 30 billion yuan.
![Pasted image 20231130201443](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341260.png)

### Exchange Traded Products
Another related pattern is the rise of exchange-traded products. In China, there are two main types of mutual funds of this kind: Listed Open-Ended Fund (LOF) （上市开放式基金）and Exchange-Traded Funds (ETF) （交易所交易基金）.
	- ETF只能在证券交易所交易，投资者只能通过券商平台购买，要开通场内基金账户。LOF则可以通过交易所像买卖股票一样交易_LOF_份额（即场内交易），也可通过基金公司直销机构，或代销银行、基金销售平台进行基金申购、赎回（即场外交易）
	- ETF_基金本质上是开放式的指数基金，是属于被动管理型的基金。LOF基金是普通的开放式基金，投资方向不受约束，交易方向比较多，可以跟踪相关指数，也可以不跟踪，主要是有基金经理来选择投资标的。
	- LOF申购门槛较低，一般1000即可申购，不过相对的管理费及申购赎回费用更高
Because LOF and ETF are of good liquidity, meaning that investors can trade anytime the market is open, and also, unlike closed-end funds, because the price of LOF and ETF generally equals net asset value, more and more investors have started trading in those products.
The next slide shows that the total TNA of LOF and ETF totaled over 700 billion yuan in 2017, or 16.5% of the market, growing from 2.7 billion and 1.2%, respectively, in 2004.
![Pasted image 20231130201602](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341261.png)

### New Development: Private Fund
In 2013, the government made substantial amendments to the Securities Investment Fund Laws and **legalized the operation of private funds**.
Private funds in China are not allowed to market their shares to the public, and they can only sell to qualified purchasers.
To qualify as purchasers, individual investors need to own more than 3 million yuan in financial assets and have an annual income of greater than a half million, while institutional investors and corporations should have net assets of over 10 million yuan. The minimum investment requirement is set to be 1 million yuan.

Private funds in China are offered in three main categories.
	1. The first category, whose official name translates as “private securities investment fund,” is equivalent to “hedge fund” in the U.S. market.
		These funds mainly trade in the secondary market of various financial assets, including stocks, bonds, and futures; they may also take leverage or use complex financial instrument to implement their strategies.
	2. The second category is private equity funds (PE), which invest mostly in equities of private firms.
	3.The third type of fund is the venture capital fund (VC), which invests in the ownership of startup firms.

The next slide shows the total number of funds and TNA by fund categories. The number of private funds have increased from 7,514 in 2014 to 74,642 in 2018—an approximately 10-times increase over only five years.
![Pasted image 20231130202216](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341262.png)
![Pasted image 20231130202222](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341263.png)

## Mutual Fund Performance
Research Question: Whether mutual funds in China generate superior performance
Data: 305 active open-end equity funds from 2003 to 2016; and 14,892 fund-month observations
Method: Regression Method

Three Models: Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), Fama-French 3-factor model (FF3), and China 4-factor model (CH4)
![Pasted image 20231130202307](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341264.png)
$r_{it}$ is the return on a portfolio of mutual funds in excess of a risk-free rate, which is proxied by a one-year deposit interest rate in China.
$MKTRF_{it}$ is the excess return on the weighted portfolio of all stocks.
Models 2 and 3 also control for other factors that can potentially affect $r_{it}$ .
The estimated coefficient on alpha is the variable of interest.
![Pasted image 20231130202448](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341265.png)
The main finding is that active equity mutual funds in China do not significantly underperform the market or other risk-adjusted benchmarks.
This is clear from the fact that, in all the specifications in the table, the point estimates of alpha are positive. Whether Chinese mutual funds significantly outperform depends on which risk model is used.
This pattern is different from the finding in the United States where actively managed mutual funds significantly underperform the market by approximately 1% per year, after taking into account expenses (Chen et al., 2004).

Although more systematic research is needed to find a definitive answer, several studies provide some insights by uncovering evidence that mutual funds in fact often make profits from front-running retail investors.
Gu et al. (2013) find that mutual fund managers, by coordinating with analysts who issue inflated “strong buy” recommendations, pump the stock price up and then dump the stocks to trend-chasing retail investors.
Hansman et al. (2018) exploit the staggered deregulation on margin trading from 2011 to 2015 and find that mutual funds increase their holdings on stocks likely to qualify for margin trading before the implementation date, and then sell to margin traders (mostly retail) afterward at higher prices.

Those findings are consistent with many anecdotal reports in China’s media that mutual funds often conduct pump-and-dump strategies of various kinds.
This type of strategy is plausibly profitable, given that mutual funds only own a small fraction of the stock market (approximately 3% to 7%) and are mostly trading against retail investors, who are strongly trend-chasing and hold more than 40% of the market.

If some funds have persistent superior performance relative to others, current outperformers should exhibit high returns also in the future.
The figure in the next slide suggests that mutual funds in China do not exhibit persistence.
![Pasted image 20231130202953](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341266.png)
The evidence shows that funds with superior performance relative to other funds in year 0 do not exhibit high returns in subsequent years.
There is a convergence of fund performance across the five groups.

## Mutual Fund Investors
According to the annual report by the Asset Management Association of China (AMAC, 2017), as of the end of 2016, the total number of active mutual fund investors was 269,546,000, which is approximately one-fifth of China’s total population.
The next figure plots the average fraction of mutual fund assets from retail investors.
The fraction is shown to be close to 90% in 2007, then decreases approximately 50% in recent years. Institutional investors invest more in mutual funds now.
![Pasted image 20231130203115](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341267.png)

AMAC conducted a survey in 2017 on more than 76,000 investors. It finds that the majority of mutual fund investors are middle-income households: 87.1% of them have after-tax income of below 150,000 yuan per year
Second, Chinese households tend to invest a small proportion of their savings in mutual funds (only 3.8%); the breakdown is 65.8% in bank deposits, 14.6% in wealth management products, and 15.9% in stock market (direct own).
By comparison, U.S. investors allocate more financial assets to mutual funds. A survey by the Investment Company Institute (2019) shows that 44.5% of U.S. households owned mutual funds in mid-2017, and among them 65% held more than half of their financial assets in mutual funds.

The third interesting finding is that investors in China are of short horizon. Only 9.2% of them hold mutual funds for more than five years, while 43.1% invest less than a year (see the chart in the next slide)
This is much shorter than that of U.S. investors, whose average horizon in mutual fund investment is believed to be seven years. For U.S. mutual fund investors, 93% of their fund investment is in savings for retirement, suggesting a very long investment horizon.

### Summary of Key Characteristics
1. Despite its fast growth, the mutual fund sector remains relatively small compared to the size of the asset market overall. In the stock market, for example, mutual funds in total own only 3% to 4% of the market capitalization, while U.S. mutual funds own approximately 30% of the stock market.
2. Similar to the global trend, China’s passive index funds and exchange-traded products grow increasingly larger, compared to active funds. The private fund sector, which includes hedge funds, private equity funds, and venture capital funds, has also been growing as a fast rate.
3. Active managed mutual funds’ return net of fees does not appear to underperform. This finding is different from the situation in the U.S., where active funds’ net return underperforms.
4. No evidence is available for persistent performance of Chinese mutual fund managers.
5. The majority of mutual fund investors are retail with a short horizon.
6. Chinese households on average allocated only 3.8% of their savings in mutual funds in 2017 but invested more than 80% of them in bank deposit and wealth management products.

# The RMB Exchange Rate
## Exchange Rate Basics
An exchange rate can be quoted in two ways:
	Direct
	The price of the foreign currency in terms of domestic currency (dollars) 1.25$/£
	Indirect
	The price of domestic currency (dollars) in terms of the foreign currency  0.8£/$
## Exchange Rate Regimes
1. Hard Pegs: dollarization, currency board
2. Soft Pegs: conventional peg, stabilized arrangement, peg within horizontal bands, crawling peg, craw-like arrangement
3. Floating Regimes:  floating, freely floating
4. Other Managed Arrangement

## China’s Evolving Exchange Rate Regime and Exchange Rate Reforms
A strictly fixed exchange rate regime (1994–2005)
Move away from a fixed exchange rate and one-way gradual appreciation (Jul 2005– Jul 2015)
Attempt at increasing flexibility, market turbulence, followed by managed depreciation (Aug 2015 – Dec 2016)
Stability against the CFETS basket of currencies (mid-2016 to end-2017)
The current regime: Increasing moves towards flexibility
![Pasted image 20231201142343](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341270.png)
In 1994, China _abandoned the multiple exchange rate system and pegged_ the RMB/USD exchange rate at 8.7, soon the rate was adjusted to 8.3.
Rationale for Adopting Exchange Rate Targeting: high inflation in the 1980s and early 1990s (implicit inflation in the planned economy era became explicit)
A Credit Exchange Rate Peg Serves a **Nominal Anchor** for Containing Inflation (Expectations)
Exchange rate stability facilitates international trade and investment

Over the past few decades, policy makers throughout the world have become increasingly aware of the social and economic costs of inflation.
A central element in successful monetary policy is the use of a nominal anchor: a nominal variable, such as the inflation rate or the money supply, which ties down the price level to achieve price stability.
Adherence to a nominal anchor that keeps the nominal variable in a narrow range promotes price stability by directly promoting low and stable inflation expectations.

A nominal anchor can limit the time-inconsistency problem.
Monetary policymakers are tempted to pursue a discretionary rather than rule-based monetary policy that is _more expansionary than firms or people expect_ because such a policy would boost economic outcome in the short run.
The rational public forms their expectations taking monetary policymakers’ pursuit of more expansionary policy into consideration. The result is a socially undesirable high inflation without a short-run gain in economic output.
Solving this problem requires policymakers to find a commitment mechanism. A nominal anchor can help.
![Pasted image 20231201143505](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341271.png)
At A, expected inflation=actual inflation=0, unemployment rate is 8%.
Once the public sets expected inflation equal to zero, the CB has incentive to deviate from that by moving to B. At B, inflation is 2% and unemployment rate is 5%.
Rational individuals will thus form an expected inflation rate equal to 2% in the first place. As a result, the PC will shift upward and equilibrium occurs at C.
Compared with A, C has higher inflation but the same unemployment rate. Both A and C are on the long-run PC, which is vertical.

### Successes and Challenges
The exchange rate targeting framework worked fairly well in the 1990s.
1) Successfully anchored inflation, inflation dropped substantially from double digits in the early 1990s to less than 5 percent thereafter
2) A credit peg along with a closed capital account and ample reserves shielded China against systematic speculative attacks during the Asian Financial Crises
3) Exchange rate stability also helped promote trade which in turn contributes to fast growth
![Pasted image 20231201145246](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341272.png)
Partly due to its success in the 1990s and mostly due to the Asian Financial Crises, policymakers abandoned necessary adjustments
Starting from the 2000s (especially after the WTO), China’s existing monetary policy framework faced serious challenges
Challenges associated with a fixed exchange rate: self-fulfilling expectations

When a central bank does not have enough official international reserve assets to maintain a fixed exchange rate, a balance of payments crisis (or currency crisis) results.
- To sustain a fixed exchange rate, the central bank must have enough foreign assets to sell in order to satisfy the demand of them at the fixed exchange rate.

Investors may expect that the domestic currency will be devalued, causing them to want foreign assets instead of domestic assets, whose value is expected to fall soon.
	1.This expectation or fear only makes the balance of payments crisis worse:
	Investors rush to change their domestic assets into foreign assets, depleting the stock of official international reserve assets more quickly.
	2.As a result, financial capital is quickly moved from domestic assets to foreign assets: capital flight.
	3.To avoid this outcome, domestic assets must offer high interest rates to entice investors to hold them.
	4.As a result, the domestic economy may face high interest rates, a reduced money supply, low aggregate demand, low output, and low employment.
	5.Expectations of devaluation can thus cause a devaluation: a self-fulfilling crisis.
![Pasted image 20231201163717](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341273.png)
To hold the exchange rate fixed at $E^0$ after the market decides it will be devalued to $E^1$, the central bank must use its reserves to finance a private financial outflow that shrinks the money supply and raises the home interest rate.

Favorable shocks → appreciation expectations → capital inflows → foreign exchange interventions  → foreign reserve accumulation → expansion of the monetary base → higher asset prices → further inflows and appreciation expectations → overvaluation
A sudden shift in expectations (caused by negative shocks) can cause a reversal of the above cycle and lead to a currency crisis (occurred later in 2015)

### *Appendix I: Brief Intro of Exchange Rate Determination Theories


We therefore say that investors are primarily concerned about the rates of return on currency deposits.
Rates of return that investors expect to earn are determined by
interest rates that the assets will earn expectations about appreciation or depreciation

#### Exchange Rate Determination
Suppose the interest rate on a dollar deposit is 2%.
Suppose the interest rate on a euro deposit is 4%.
Does a euro deposit yield a higher expected rate of return?
- Suppose today the exchange rate is $1/€1, and the expected rate one year in the future is $0.97/€1.
- $100 can be exchanged today for €100.
- These €100 will yield €104 after one year.
- These €104 are expected to be worth $0.97/€1 × €104 = $100.88 in one year

The rate of return in terms of dollars from investing in euro deposits is
$$\frac{(\$100.88-\$100)}{\$100}=0.88\%$$
Let’s compare this rate of return with the rate of return from a dollar deposit.
- The rate of return is simply the interest rate.
- After 1 year the $100 is expected to yield $102:
$$\frac{(\$102-\$100)}{\$100}=2\%$$
The euro deposit has a lower expected rate of return: thus, **all** investors should be willing to dollar deposits, and **none** should be willing to hold euro deposits

Note that the expected rate of appreciation of the euro was
$$\frac{\$0.97-\$1}{\$1}=-3\%$$
We simplify the analysis by saying that the dollar rate of return on euro deposits approximately equals
- the interest rate on euro deposits
- plus the expected rate of appreciation of euro deposits
- $4\%+-3\%=1\%\approx 0.88\%$
$$R_{\texteuro}+\frac{E^e_{\$/\texteuro}-E_{\$/\texteuro}}{E_{\$/\texteuro}}$$

If people expect the euro to appreciate in the future, then euro-denominated assets will pay in valuable euros, so that these future euros will be able to buy many dollars and many dollar-denominated goods.
- The expected rate of return on euros therefore increases.
- An expected appreciation of a currency leads to an actual appreciation (a self-fulfilling prophecy).
- An expected depreciation of a currency leads to an actual depreciation (a self-fulfilling prophecy).

### *Appendix II: Chronicle of RMB Exchange Rate Reforms

In 1994, China abandoned the multiple exchange rate system and pegged the RMB/USD exchange rate at 8.7, soon the rate was adjusted to 8.3.

July 21, 2005: initiated the reforms by allowing the Yuan to appreciate but still used central parity fixing to control the speed of appreciation (daily fluctuation limit is 0.3 % from the central parity). The Yuan against the dollar appreciated by 2% on that day

July 22, 2005: began announcing the Yuan's closing rate against major currencies on the inter-bank market

Jan. 11, 2007: The central parity rate against the U.S. dollar topped 7.8. The Yuan's value exceeded the Hong Kong dollar for the first time in 13 years.

May 21, 2007: The Yuan's value was allowed to fluctuate by 0.5 % from the central parity rate each trading day

April 16, 2012: The Yuan's value was allowed to rise or fall by 1 percent from the central parity rate each trading day

March 17, 2014: The Yuan’s value was allowed to rise or fall by 2 percent from the central parity rate each trading day

Aug. 11, 2015: Daily central parity quotes reported to CFETS before the market opens became based on the closing rate of the inter-bank foreign exchange market on the previous day, supply and demand in the market, and price movement of major currencies

## RMB Exchange Rate, China’s Current Account, and Global Imbalances
![Pasted image 20231106095939](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341275.png)
![Pasted image 20231201150217](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341276.png)
During the first half of the 2000s, the large U.S. current account deficit was matched by the surpluses of Asian countries (notably China), Latin America, and oil exporters. After 2008 the imbalances shrank temporarily, but have since increased again.

### The Real Exchange Rate
The real exchange rate is the rate of exchange for goods and services across countries.
- In other words, it is the relative value/price/cost of goods and services across countries.
- For example, it is the dollar price of a European group of goods and services relative to the dollar price of an American group of goods and services:
$$q_{\frac{US}{EU}}=\frac{E_{\$/\texteuro}\times P_{EU}}{P_{US}}$$
If the EU basket costs €100, the U.S. basket costs $120, and the nominal exchange rate is $1.20 per euro, then the real exchange rate is 1 U.S. basket per 1 EU basket.
**A real depreciation (appreciation)** of the value of U.S. products means a fall (rise) in a dollar′s purchasing power of EU products relative to a dollar′s purchasing power of U.S. products.
This implies that **U.S. goods become less (more) expensive** relative to EU goods.

### Determinants of the Current Account
Determinants of the current account include:
- Real exchange rate
- Disposable Income
![Pasted image 20231201150820](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341277.png)
The current account measures the value of exports relative to the value of imports:
$$CA\approx EX-IM$$
When the real exchange rate $\frac{EP^*}{P}$ rises, the prices of foreign products rise relative to the prices of domestic products.

Since a rise in $Y^d$ causes domestic consumers to increase their spending on _all_ goods, including imports from abroad, an increase in disposable income worsens the current account, other things equal. (An increase in $Y^d$  has no effect on export demand because we are holding foreign income constant and not allowing $Y^d$ to affect it.)

### The U.S. Current Account Deficits
The U.S. current account deficits, on the other hand, reflects the fact that it invests more than it saves
Over the last four decades, saving and investment have continued on a downward trend in the U.S., but saving was lower than investment in almost all years
The low saving rate in the U.S. is also a result of a series social and economic issues, and one of the reasons is due to the special role of the dollar which allows it to borrow cheaply from abroad (the exobitant previlege)
![Pasted image 20231201152129](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341278.png)

### The Exorbitant Privilege
There is a measure called net international investment position (NIIP.) The U.S. NIIP is about negative $4.6 trillion, meaning that foreigners own about $4.6 trillion more of U.S. assets than Americans own of foreign assets
However, the U.S. enjoyed a positive and a large net investment income! The implies that due to the special role of the dollar, the U.S. can borrow cheaply from abroad and then invest in other countries to get a much higher return!
China has a large and positive NIIP, but its net investment income is negative

[Onshore RMB (CNY) and offshore RMB (CNH) markets](https://www.mizuhogroup.com/binaries/content/assets/pdf/mizuho-bank/insights/cndb/press/r525-0007-xf-0102.pdf)
“Onshore RMB” refers to RMB that circulates within Mainland China, while “offshore RMB” refers to RMB that circulates outside Mainland China.

Absolute PPP: purchasing power parity that has already been discussed. Exchange rates equal the level of relative average prices across countries.
$$E_{\$/\texteuro}=\frac{R_{US}}{R_{EU}}$$
Relative PPP: changes in exchange rates equal changes in prices (inflation) between two periods:
$$\frac{(E_{\$/\texteuro,t}-E_{\$/\texteuro,t-1})}{E_{\$/\texteuro,t-1}}=\pi_{u.s,t}-\pi_{E.U,t}$$
where $\pi_t=$ inflation rate from period $t-1$ to $t$



The surplus is due to undervalued exchange rate.
## The Internationalization of RMB
### Benefits and costs of being an international currency
Does China want the RMB to be an international currency?
Benefits: 
1) avoid exchange risks in trade and investment; 
2) force the PBC to achieve price stability; 
3) gain seiginorage(铸币权);  
4) reduce loss associated with reserve accumulation for China and other countries (demand effect + competition effect); 
5) risk diversification (for other countries)
Costs: 
1) the so-called internationalization trap (the japanese lesson), risks associated with exchange rate appreciations and capital account openness; 
2) partly lose monetary autonomy and policy effectiveness

### The progress of RMB internationalization
RMB internationalization started from **going regional at first**, thanks to China’s close trade ties with neighboring economies as well as its relative larger size compared to most of these economies.
Since 1993, the PBC has successively signed **local currency settlement agreements on border trade** with central banks of bordering countries.
After China became a member of the WTO, its border trade further expanded. Since the RMB was on an appreciation trend, the neighboring countries increasingly accepted RMB while Chinese citizens were also willing to use RMB to reduce loss in currency exchanges.

As a result, the demand for RMB as **a payment currency in border trade gradually grew**.
However, RMB settlements in cross-border trade were uneven across different regions, and its overall volume was rather limited.
For example, 80% of China–Vietnam border trade in Guangxi Province was settled with RMB while that of China–Russia border trade only stood at 0.1% in 2008.

After Hong Kong and Macau returned to China, their economic and trade ties with the mainland have grown stronger, so RMB business was quickly developed.
Despite the rapid growth of RMB business in Hong Kong SAR, the overall size was still limited where the balance of RMB deposits in Hong Kong SAR at end-2008 was only RMB 56.1 billion.
![Pasted image 20231201153539](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341282.png)

#### Significant Acceleration after the GFC
The crisis had a smaller effect on the Chinese economy and its financial markets. Since China was a major trading partner to most countries and regions across the globe, its companies gained increasing recognition in using RMB for cross-border trade settlements, and the currency was acknowledged as **a source of international liquidity** by an increasing number of foreign central banks.
In addition, foreign exchange reserves in China continued to grow rapidly, supporting a strong expectation for RMB appreciation in the foreign exchange market and propelling foreign investors to invest in the Chinese financial market. With all these favorable factors, the global demand of RMB rose rapidly, generating rare opportunities for RMB internationalization.

Facing a significant increase of international demand for RMB, China took the historic opportunity to **promote the use of RMB in cross-border trade and investment**.
Since 2009, the Chinese government stepped up to gradually remove the existent institutional obstacles in the cross-border use of RMB. RMB internalization progressed rapidly in all aspects, ranging from trade settlement to investment settlement, from direct investment to security investment, and from the domestic market to the offshore markets.
So far, it has broadly gone through three stages:
	Stage 1: The RMB internationalization moved fast from 2009 to 2015. In this stage, multiple pilot programs of RMB cross-border use were launched and the institutional obstacles were removed step by step.
	The RMB internationalization experienced its “golden era” with rapid growths in the settlement amount of various transactions. This stage came to its peak when RMB was included into the SDR’s ([Special Drawing Rights](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sdr.asp#:~:text=Special%20drawing%20rights%20%28SDRs%29%20are%20an%20artificial%20currency,yen%2C%20the%20Chinese%20renminbi%2C%20and%20the%20British%20pound.)) currency basket.
	Stage 2: The pace slowed down from 2015 to 2017. In this period, China faced severe capital outflows. As overseas investors perceived uncertainty over the trending of RMB and the economic and financial situation throughout China, some of the RMB cross-border operations were affected.
	Stage 3: RMB internationalization steadily recovered after 2017. This occurred against a background of a steadily growing Chinese economy and financial markets. Moreover, administrative policies on capital flows were successively eased and supported the opening-up of Chinese financial markets.

### Will the RMB become a major international reserve currency?
A major reserve currency? Still at long way to go.
According to the IMF, in Q1 of 2022, the total value of RMB reserves hold by other central banks was about 336.4 billion USD, accounting for a share of 2.88% in total global foreign reserve holdings.

货币国际化是指一个国家或地区所发行的货币在该国或地区之外成为具有计价单位、交易媒介和价值储藏功能的货币。为衡量一国货币的国际化程度，可以选取与支付货币、投资货币、融资货币和储备货币等国际货币功能相关的一些关键指标进行定量评估。为衡量人民币国际化发展程度，在参考相关货币国际化指数和 SDR 审查指标的基础上，我们构建了货币国际化综合指数。

我们构建的货币国际化综合指数包含四个一级指标,分别反映支付货币、投资货币、融资货币和储备货币功能。在二级指标中，用全球支付货币份额指标衡量支付货币功能: 用国际银行业对外负债、外汇交易市场份额、外汇即期交易使用份额、利率衍生品市场份额等指标衡量投资货币功能: 用全球贸易融资货币份额、国际银行业对外债权、国际债券发行比例等指标衡量融资货币功能: 用全球外汇储备币种构成指标衡量储备货币功能 (表 1)

以上述指标衡量的结果显示（图1），近年来人民币国际化指数总体呈上升态势。2021年末，人民币国际化综合指数为2.80，同比上升17%。同期，美元、欧元、英镑、日元等主要国际货币国际化指数分别为58.13、21.81、8.77和4.93。
2022年第一季度，人民币国际化综合指数为2.86，同比上升14%。同期，美元、欧元、英镑、日元等国际货币国际化指数分别为58.13、21.56、8.87和4.96。

# Capital Account Openness and Financial Stability in China
## Pros and Cons of Capital Account Openness
__Neoclassical economic theory__ predicts a clear benefit that an open capital account facilitates **more-efficient allocation of capital across borders**— in other words, more globally diversified portfolios for households plus lower financing costs for businesses.
However, the e**mpirical literature has failed to identify a robust effect** of a change in capital account openness on economic growth.

Even worse, open capital accounts tend to **pose significant risks to EMEs**, including sudden stops, capital flights, currency crises, and rising inequality. (EME:Emerging Market Economy)
China’s own capital reversal experience in 2015-2016 seems to echo these empirical findings.
In addition to financial safety concerns, the Trilemma theorem suggests that capital account openness under a fixed exchange rate regime would result in **loss of monetary autonomy**.
![Pasted image 20231130204742](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341293.png)
The vertices of the triangle show three features that policy makers in open economies would prefer their monetary system to achieve. Unfortunately, at most two can coexist. Each of the three policy regime labels along the triangle’s edges (floating exchange rate, fixed exchange rate, financial controls) is consistent with the two goals that it lies between in the diagram.

Trilemma: A country cannot achieve the following 3 goals simultaneously: 1) Exchange rate stability; 2) Free capital mobility; 3) Monetary policy independence
Interest rate parity condition: with free capital mobility, domestic interest=foreign interest rate+ expected depreciation rate of the domestic currency：
$R_{\$}=R_{\texteuro}+\frac{E^e_{\$/\texteuro}-E_{\$/\texteuro}}{E_{\$/\texteuro}}$
For a fixed exchange rate regime $\frac{E^e_{\$/\texteuro}-E_{\$/\texteuro}}{E_{\$/\texteuro}}$ ,meaning that domestic interest rate must be equal to foreign interest rate (loss of monetary policy independence)

Under a fixed exchange rate, domestic interest rate will be forced to be equal to the foreign rate due to arbitrage if free capital mobility is allowed
Loss of monetary autonomy
Impose restrictions on the capital account to maintain monetary independence (also financial stability)

Nonetheless, convertible capital accounts seem to offer better benefit-risk tradeoffs for advanced economies than for EMEs.
The literature points to a “threshold effect,” in which for economies above a certain threshold (income per capita, financial depth, institutional quality, etc.) openness are less likely to cause crises and more likely to boost growth.
As China’s economy continues to develop, the benefit-risk tradeoff may become more favorable over time. Perhaps for this reason, China has not shunned away from opening up its capital account.

Even if the direct, neoclassical benefit is ambiguous, capital account liberalization may bring indirect, “collateral” benefits.
For China, an important collateral benefit is to improve financial sector openness and promote financial reforms.
Another collateral benefit is to accommodate RMB’s internationalization. An internationally accepted RMB will better facilitate China’s trade and investment with global partners.

Trade openness erodes the effectiveness of controls
Carry trade under the disguise of trade of goods; misinvoicing(进出口谎报)

In addition, as China’s became increasingly open to international trade and FDI, capital control measures became less effective and costly.
As a matter of fact, despite tight control measures, China ranks #1 in the world in terms of illicit capital flows (global financial integrity: [www.gfintegrity.org](http://www.gfintegrity.org/)).

In conclusion, by proceeding carefully and cautiously, reaping these benefits is possible.
The associated risks, however, should also be dealt carefully with by coordinating financial and exchange rate reforms. This explains why policymakers in China are cautiously committed to capital account openness.
## A Historical Review of China’s Capital Account Openness
China’s four decades of capital account liberalization can be divided into six stages: 79-91, 92-97, 97-07, 08-13, 13-16, 17-present
In the early stages, capital account policy was rather restrictive, so that foreign direct investments dominated capital account, and inflows dominated outflows.
As time went by, non-FDI gained more freedom to flow across the border. Therefore, capital account has become more volatile.

### First Welcome to Capital Inflows: 1979–1991
The promulgation of the Joint Ventures Law in 1979 marked China’s first step to open up its capital account.
In the same year, China established four Special Economic Zones on its southeast coast as pilot destinations for foreign investment, offering tax incentives and managerial autonomy.  Since then, other provincial and local governments followed suit. In response to the broadening of preferential treatments, China’s FDI grew steadily.
Interestingly, despite Chinese authority’s preference for FDI, **it was other investment (lending-related) that contributed the most to capital inflows in this period**.
![Pasted image 20231130212718](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341295.png)

### FDI Expansion and Setback of Early Ambition: 1992–1997
Deng Xiaoping’s Southern Tour in 1992 irreversibly reoriented China’s national priority toward Reform and Opening-up.
Since then, foreign capital became **increasingly confident** in venturing into China. FDI inflows surged by ten-fold from $4.4 billion in 1991 to $44 billion in 1997.
In addition, the source of FDI inflows became **more diversified**: An increasing share of FDI came from major developed economies.

More dramatic changes took place in exchange rate and current account. In 1994, the PBC abolished the dual-tracked exchange rates in favor of a single, market-based managed floating exchange rate regime.
In 1996, China made its current account fully convertible, greatly reducing the cost of trade.

China also released **an ambitious plan** in 1993 to reach full capital account liberalization by 2000. Unfortunately, **the plan was suspended** as the 1997 Asian financial crisis (AFC) broke out.
Due to China’s abundant FX reserves and capital outflow controls, RMB’s peg against the dollar remained intact. But the crisis demonstrated the destructive power of fickle capital flows, forcing policymakers to **think twice before liberalizing portfolio and other investment flows**.

### Dual Surplus and Q Schemes: 1997-2007
In response to the crisis, China, like many other Asian countries, had doubled efforts in building up reserves as a precaution.
China’s accession to the WTO in 2001 fueled the exponential growth of its exports and current account surplus.
Moreover, the export sector boosted China’s economic growth and helped to attract more inward FDI, creating both the “dual surplus” and, as its mirror image, the rapid accumulation of official reserves.

As the fear of crisis eventually faded away, China resumed its capital account liberalization plan in a cautious manner.
In late 2002, China unveiled the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors **(QFII) program**, granting access to a range of domestic financial markets. The program quickly became popular as global investors diversified into China.
For ODI (outward direct investment), China began to **encourage domestic enterprises to “go abroad”** to secure the supply of key commodities and move up the value chain.

For portfolio outflows, China introduced the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors **(QDII) program** in 2006.
Despite ODI and QDII, capital outflows remained dwarfed by inflows as FDI and hot money disguised as either FDI or trade surplus continued to pour in. RMB’s appreciation pressure quickly built up.

As a result, the PBC de-pegged(脱钩) RMB from the dollar in July 2005.
China also strengthened controls on capital inflows.
However, the policy measures were too weak to offset the giant and burgeoning dual surplus. By the end of 2007, China’s current account surplus reached 10% of its GDP, pushing up its FX reserves to $1.5 trillion—an astonishing six-fold increase in just five years.
![Pasted image 20231130213731](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341296.png)

#### The Q Schemes
In late 2002, China unveiled the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) program, its first scheme-based liberalization for portfolio investment. QFIIs are allowed to **convert their FX into RMB and to invest in a range of RMB-denominated assets**, including the A shares.
The popularity of QFII was evidenced by its rapidly expanding approved quota, from $1.7 billion by the end of 2003 to $10 billion in January 2007, exhausting the maximum quota then allowed.
In the next decade, maximum QFII quota was raised several times, from $10 billion to $30 billion in 2007, $80 billion in 2012, and $150 billion since 2015. By August 2018, total approved QFII quota had reached $100 billion.

China introduced the **Qualified Domestic Institutional Investors (QDII) program** in 2006. This was the first scheme-based liberalization for **domestic institutional investors to access 11 overseas financial markets**. Total approved QDII quota started at $10 billion in 2006. By June 2018, it reached $103 billion.
Initially, QDIIs could only invest in fixed-income securities. A year later in 2007, they were granted access to equities. Over time, QDIIs were allowed to invest in broader sets of assets, and to more flexibly manage asset allocations

The Renminbi Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (RQFII) program was introduced in 2011. RQFIIs are **allowed to invest in China’s domestic markets using their offshore RMB holdings** (as opposed to foreign currency) directly.
In the early days, only Hong Kong subsidiaries of domestic financial institutions could apply for RQFIIs. Later, RQFII expanded to global asset managers’ HK offices.
By the end of 2013, total approved RQFII quota amounted to 157 billion RMB. By August 2018, the total approved RQFII quota had reached 627 billion RMB.

### Liberalization and Carry Trade: 2008–2013
After the GFC, China announced the “4 trillion” stimulus package to make up for the depressed external demand. Domestic investment demand rebounded sharply, especially in infrastructure and real estate.
China also relaxed many capital inflow regulations to accommodate for the stimulus-driven financing needs. For FDI, the registration procedures were substantially streamlined in 2012.
For portfolio inflows, China raised the QFII quota, and introduced the RQFII program in 2011.

For lending-related inflows, in 2010 China relaxed qualifications on overseas loans under domestic guarantee (“neibao waidai”), allowing domestic companies, guaranteed by domestic banks, to borrow from overseas.
In the meantime, major foreign central banks **slashed policy rates to the zero** lower bound and carried out massive QE programs. Once the overseas borrowing restrictions were relaxed, the strong domestic demand and excess global liquidity created a perfect storm of capital pouring into China.
Global crisis, domestic stimulus, and inflow liberalization had dramatically changed the structure of China’s balance of payments. The current account surplus fell from 10% of GDP in 2007 to less than 2% in 2011.

Capital account surplus, by contrast, continued to rise as inflow liberalization measures kicked in, dominating current account surplus in 2010, 2011, and 2013.
While FDI inflows remained the biggest contributor to capital account surplus, other inflows began to play an increasingly important role in capital account fluctuations. In particular, the interest rate spread and the appreciation of the RMB induced large short-term carry trade inflows.
But unlike FDI, **carry trade inflows are much more volatile and short-term in nature**. It turned out that the carry trade inflows from 2010 to 2013 had sowed the seed of a sharp reversal.

### Liberalization Met Carry Trade Reversal: 2013–2016
Since 2013, China’s capital account management has undergone a paradigm shift. A **“negative list” approach** initially gained favor. Instead of relying on ex-ante(事前估计) review and approval, regulators refocused on ex-post monitoring and regulation for an expanding set of cross-border transactions, especially outflows.
As a result, capital account liberalization moved up a gear. By mid-2015, both FDI and ODI had become “almost fully” convertible. For portfolio flows, China expanded the existing QFII, QDII, and RQFII programs, and established a number of new schemes.
In late 2014, China unveiled the **Shanghai–Hong Kong Stock Connect**, allowing both institutional and individual investors to participate in the two markets with greater ease.

These opening-up measures facilitated an unprecedented sharp rise in capital outflows.
Part of the rise in outflows reflected the long-desired diversification of Chinese households and businesses toward global assets.
However, the rest of the outflows were much less benign. The carry trade(利差交易) inflows built up since the GFC(global financial crisis) had unwound their positions and quickly withdrawn from China, generating the sudden reversal.

Five years after the crisis, the U.S. economy had gradually recovered. In 2014, the Federal Reserve concluded its QE3 program, and hinted about hiking the federal funds rate later.
From 2013 to 2015, China’s economy slowed as rising labor costs and strong RMB reduced its export competitiveness, and as the debt-fueled stimulus package ran out of steam.
Gradually, RMB became overvalued. The burst of the stock bubble in mid-2015 stoked more worries of a hard landing. As a result, carry trade unwound, and the RMB depreciated, and China’s FX reserves shrank.

![Pasted image 20231201003132](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341299.png)

### Economic Rebound and Resumption of Liberalization: Since 2017
China’s economy rebounded since mid-2016, thanks to the supply-side structural reform and a solid recovery of global demand.
As the economy stabilized and markets calmed down, China relaxed the enforcement of capital controls, and resumed its concerted efforts to opening up. In April 2018, President Xi Jinping emphasized in Boao that China is firmly committed to opening up further.
For inward FDI, China initiated new opening-up measures and reduced investment restrictions. For the existing Q Schemes, China expanded the quotas, and made them more flexible. For the Stock Connects, China increased the limits for the two existing ones, and prepared to launch a new Shanghai–London Stock Connect. China had also resumed its liberalization for alternative investments.

## How Much Has China Actually Opened Its Capital Account?

A commonly used data source is the International Monetary Fund’s Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER), which records the statutory regimes of exchange rate and trade for IMF members.
The Chinn-Ito index, a popular measure, has a value of –1.20 for China, compared with +0.3 for EMEs, and +2.36 for advanced economies. This makes China the 104th of 182 sampled economies in terms of openness. More surprisingly, China’s value has been unchanged since 1993. The Quinn index exhibits an improving trend for China since 2005. Yet, as of 2016, China’s openness still trails an average EME.

The main issue is AREAER’s binary nature. It tracks restrictions but is less accurate in capturing **how strictly they are enforced**. Only major policy shifts can change AREAER’s values.
But China has opened up its capital account gradually. **For most types of capital transactions, restrictions are relaxed rather than removed**.

![Pasted image 20231201003601](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341300.png)

A less controversial alternative is **de facto openness**, which measures an economy’s financial integration into global markets.
The standard metric for aggregate de facto openness is an economy’s **external assets and liabilities as a percent of GDP**, based on its international investment positions.
From 2004 to 2017, both external assets and liabilities in China had more than sextupled. In 2017, China’s external assets and liabilities stood at 57.6% and 42.5% of its GDP, respectively. These ratios imply that **China’s capital account is more open than other EMEs such as India, but less open than advanced economies**.

The composition of China’s IIP also points to rising de facto openness.
On the asset side, 71% of China’s external assets were reserves in 2009. By 2017, reserves’ share declined to 47%.
On the liability side, FDI consistently dominated external liabilities, but portfolio investments’ share increased rapidly from 9% in 2004 to 20% in 2017.

![Pasted image 20231201003752](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341301.png)

The **co-movement of domestic and foreign long-term bond yields** suggests that improving market integration across the border is occurring, hence rising de facto openness.
Since 2012, the correlation between China and U.S. 10-year government bond yields has been high at 0.7.
**A logical conclusion is that China’s capital account has become substantially more convertible**. Although opening-up has been slow and bumpy, especially for non-FDI flows, the overall trend points clearly to an increasingly open capital account.

![Pasted image 20231201004012](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341302.png)

While China imposes more controls on non-FDI flows, it is highly open to FDI flow. As a matter of fact, it is more open to FDI flows than advanced countries in the de facto sense.
Below is some evidence from Lin and Ye (2018).
![Pasted image 20231201004110](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341303.png)
![Pasted image 20231201004123](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341304.png)

## How Will China Open Up Its Capital Account Further?
There are different views on opening up a country’s capital account.
The **preconditions** view argues that liberalization relies on the fulfillment of many preconditions, including stable macroeconomic fundamentals, a sound banking system, and developed financial markets.
Some argue that because of its weak banking system, regulation loopholes, underdeveloped financial markets, and lack of a flexible exchange rate, China was not ready to make its capital account convertible.

The **sequencing** view holds that policymakers should design and follow an optimal sequence of reforms, such as liberalizing domestic trade and finance first, followed by exchange rate flexibility, and lastly by capital account liberalization.
The **stability** view warns that reform and opening-up may become destabilizing in the near term. In particular, lifting controls and regulations all at once may give rise to spikes in exchange rate volatility, and to sharp cross-border flow swings, thus threatening both financial and macroeconomic stability.

All 3 views have merits, yet they are also limited. The argument against the _preconditions view_ is that some preconditions cannot realize before the reforms.
The argument against the sequencing view is that situations are often complex and fast-changing, and disagreements among policymakers tend to erect political hurdles. While economists can sometimes deduce from economic principles an optimal sequence of reforms, political interests often make the problem so complex that no optimal sequencing can be found.

The argument against the stability view is that short-term stability may come at the price of destabilization in the long run.

In practice, China’s policymakers have favored a **“troika” approach**, by coordinating exchange rate, capital account liberalization, and financial reforms.
This approach has built in **both gradualism and opportunism**. Instead of preconditions or sequencing, it focuses **on pushing the lagging reforms forward to catch up on other reforms**, so that over time, all reforms are marching ahead.
More favorable domestic and external conditions will allow policymakers to push the reforms faster, while adverse shocks may slow them down.
This approach is less prone to rollbacks, so policymakers have suggested using the “ratchet effect” (i.e., irreversibility) of opening up as a commitment device for financial and exchange rate reforms.

To sum up, China still needs some capital controls measures for both financial stability and monetary autonomy
But controls become increasingly ineffective and are not consistent with the commitment of RMB internationalization
Other reforms such as increasing the exchange rate flexibility and developing domestic financial markets are important for further capital account liberation

In the future, we should expect to see China moving gradually from the corner solution of the policy trilemma to the **interior solution**: more exchange rate flexibility + more relaxation on capital controls
Adopting a **sound macroprudential policy framework** is also important for financial safety while opening up
**Better designed capital account management tools** would also help to alleviate the potential risks

# The Fiscal System, Land Finance, and Local Government Debt

## Government Revenue and Expenditures: Some Public Finance Basics
### How Should the Government Be Funded? (Revenue)   
The economics of public finance provides an answer to this fundamental question: the tax base should be **broad**; tax rates should be as **even** as possible, and the system should be **feasible** given the country’s level of development.

A broad tax base is important because it (1) permits tax rates to be as low as possible for a given level of need; and (2) spreads the tax over as many taxpayers as possible, so it is **fairer**.

**Capacity to collect taxes grows along with economic development**. Governments in underdeveloped societies that are rural and small scale have little capacity to collect revenues.
They typically rely on taxes collected on **foreign trade** or a few **monopoly goods** (such as salt and iron in traditional China) or on **printing money** (seigniorage).
As countries develop, they collect more taxes. Low-income countries collect an average of 14.5% of GDP in taxes; middle-income countries collect 18.7%, and high-income countries collect 32.5% (Baunsgaard and Keen, 2010).

The key innovation that allowed developed countries to collect more were the two important taxes introduced during the early twentieth century: the **personal income tax** and **the value-added tax**.
These two taxes effectively broaden the tax base, but they are quite **difficult to implement before a certain stage of development**: not until most workers have regular jobs and payments are made through the banking system.
### What Should the Fiscal System Provide? (Expenditures)
In a market economy, we can rely on the private sector to provide ordinary goods.
Government should provide goods and services in 3 situations in which the market does not work efficiently or different outcomes are desired: **public goods; goods with positive externalities; and socially favored redistribution**.
Public goods are goods and services that are “**nonexcludable**” and “**nonrival**”.
![Pasted image 20231201114240](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341305.png)

Government may provide goods when there are positive externalities. For example, basic R&D provides benefits to society through the diffusion of new technologies, form which the researcher cannot appropriate all the benefits. Without government support, research would be underprovided, and government subsidies are appropriate.
Finally, government can redistribute income. Redistribution can occur from rich to poor, from healthy to sick, and from working people to the young and to retirees.

## The Chinese Fiscal System and the1994 Fiscal Reform
Under the command economy, government revenues were raised from tens of thousands of **SOEs with monopoly powers** rather than households.
SOEs were profitable because they had monopolies. Government control of the price system was used to concentrate revenues in those firms, the government then collected revenues from them, and entry and competition were prohibited.

This system eroded and then collapsed between 1978-1994. New firms entered the most lucrative markets, competition spread rapidly throughout the economy, and without state monopoly profits, there was no revenue to run the government.
By the early 1990s, China was in a deep **Fiscal Crisis**.
![Pasted image 20231201115455](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341306.png)
On the expenditure side, the Chinese government spent an enormous amount of time and resources doing things that the free market could do.
During the reform, the government stopped trying to do everything and focused on the things that only government can do well.
The government cut back on investment, subsidies, and military expenditures while core government outlays for administration and social services (“current civilian” in the figure in the next slide) were successfully protected.

### The Tax Reform of 1994
China enacted a sweeping reform of the fiscal system in 1994 comparable with a market system.
The reform had **3 crucial elements**: new taxes, a new central government taxation agency, and a tax-assignment and sharing system.
The most important new tax was the **value-added tax (VAT)** levied on most manufactured goods at a uniform rate of 17%.

A 33% **profit tax** was introduced, with uniform rates for state, collective, and private enterprises, while FDI firms could still enjoy their concessionary tax deals until 2008.
A **consumption tax** was introduced for cigarettes, alcohol, and other luxuries. Several minor local taxes were also introduced. The previous SOE profit contract system was eliminated.
Policymakers created the centrally controlled **State Administration of Taxation (SAT)** with the power to collect the most important taxes, including the VAT.

In the **tax-assignment and sharing system**, central government taxes included the consumption tax, customer duties(关税), and most direct and indirect taxes on central-government-controlled sectors. Provincial taxes included direct taxes on local enterprises and some modest taxes.
The key provision was the designation of most **VAT revenues as “shared income,” with 75% going to the central government and 25% to the local government**. The SAT first collect the bulk of the revenues and then shares them with provinces.

Overall, the reform was an enormous success. Chinese consolidated budget revenues increased steadily and doubled as a share of GDP by 2012. They then leveled off at around 22% of GDP. In US dollar value, Chinese budget revenues increased from 113 billion in 1995 to 2.4 trillion in 2016. For comparison, U.S. federal government on-budget revenues were 1.97 trillion for 2012.
Solved the fiscal crisis that China had faced at the beginning of the decade.
But the reform focused mainly on resolving central government’s fiscal difficulties, it **did not provide local government with an adequate tax base**. As detailed in the remaining part of the lecture, this had profound impacts on the Chinese economy in the next several decades.

## Central and Local: The Paradox of China’s Fiscal System

Every large country face difficult choices between centralization and decentralization of government functions.
In the assignment of fiscal responsibilities, there is a fundamental trade-off between centralized and local responsibility.
First, one basic principle is that the management should be “**as local as possible**,” so the government can respond easily to citizens’ preferences and values. This is especially important if different regions have different preferences for the level and quality of public services they demand.

### How Should Revenue and Responsibility be Divided Among Governments? Some Principles
To be effective, however, **decentralization requires good-quality local governance**, which in turn requires local governments have adequate, trained personnel and the capacity to collect revenues and provide services efficiently.
Second, **certain public goods**, such as national defense and the legal and regulatory framework, **can only be provided by the central government**. In addition, only the central government can redistribute resources across regions.
Finally, each level of **government should have control of sufficient revenue to cover the expenditures** for which it is responsible. The central can maintain a system of intergovernmental transfers. These transfers should be predictable, transparent, and rule driven. Otherwise, conflicts between levels of government are inevitable.

### The Paradox of China’s Fiscal System
The Paradox: **revenues are highly centralized, but expenditures are highly decentralized**.
The central government sets all tax types and tax rates.
Local governments have no autonomous rights to levy taxes and, until recently, were forbidden to borrow (although they did anyway).
By all these indicators, China’s fiscal system is highly centralized.

Regarding expenditure, however, the Chinese fiscal system is one of the most decentralized in the world. In 2016, the central carried out 15% of total expenditures while local governments carried out the remaining 85%.
As shown in the figure in the next slide, local government expenditures have grown steadily as a share of GDP since the 1994 reform.
Across countries, expenditure is more decentralized in China than many other countries, including India and the U.S.
The central collects the lion’s share of revenue and the local are dependent on the center for budgetary transfers.

## The Rise of Land Finance

Faced with inadequate resources for fiscal expenditures and local development, local governments need find alternative ways to raise revenues.
City governments discovered that their **monopoly control of the conversion of rural land to urban land eligible for development** could generate the resources they need.
In China, rural people are strictly forbidden to develop agriculture land for urban use. Instead, they must sell their land, and the only entity authorized to purchase that land is the city government.

In practice, city governments purchase developable land from farmers (exploiting their monopolistic position to buy low), install infrastructure, and sell the land-use rights to developers (exploiting their monopolistic position to sell high).
Local governments have been able to consistently raise substantial amount of money from the sell of land.
City governments in China have become land developers; their resources and achievements are inseparable from their success in developing land.

### Shortcomming of Land Finance
This system has many shortcomings. First, it continuously involves local-government officials in **direct interventions** in the economy. Since local-governments also have strong regulatory and policy responsibilities, the potential for conflict of interest is great.
Second, with land dependence, local government entrepreneurship can take on an unhealthy form. Officials have **strong incentives to develop GDP but weak incentives to provide high-quality services** to urban residents. They overemphasize the urbanization of land but obstruct the urbanization of people.
![Pasted image 20231201130742](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/meteor0823/BlogImage/main/202312021341315.png)
Third, it encourages corruption and inside dealing.
Finally, it creates an undesirable pro-cyclical pattern in municipal finance. When times are good, city revenues increase and city expenditures grow rapidly, but when times are bad, city revenues drop, and it is difficult for city governments to help the local economy using fiscal policies.

When the 2008 global financial crisis hit, the return to land-development activities declined sharply, leading local officials to pull back on investment.
In order to prevent this pro-cyclical response which would have worsened the downturn, central policymakers encourage local governments to take on new debt, in the process creating a serious problem of local-government debt.

## Local Government Debt
Until 2014, LG in China have **had no legal power to borrow** money and go into debt.
Despite the clear legal prohibition, LG have **always borrowed** money. The most common way for a LG to circumvent the prohibition has been to set up a local investment company or development guarantee. 
Such operations have a long history in China, but during most periods the central government has **vigilantly monitored** and limited such activities.

During the GFC, **the attitude of the central government shifted** from cautiously restraining LG investment vehicles to actively promoting them.
As a result, new **LG financing vehicles (LGFVs) proliferated** as instruments for LG to accelerate in investments as quickly as possible. 
**State-owned banks were urged to lend generously** and to keep the money flowing. These steps led to **a rapid explosion of the debt of LFGVs**, which double from 2007-2009, from 4.5 trillion RMB to 9 trillion RMB, with over 80% of the funds coming from the banking system.

A serious LG debt problem was created.
1. The National Audit Office (NAO) conducted a study of LG debt as of June 2013, and discovered a total of 10.89 trillion RMB for which LG had direct repayment obligations and a further 2.7 trillion in debt that LG had guaranteed, plus 4.3 trillion of potential or contingent liability.
More alarming than the total volume of this debt is the fact that it existed in a kind of legal never-never land. LG cannot legally borrow or guarantee debt, but the NAO published detailed figures on the borrowing and guarantees of LG.

利息覆盖率的计算方法是将公司在一定时期内的息税前利润（_EBIT_）除以其利息支出

A comprehensive effort to manage LG debt was launched in 2014. A revised Budget Law **gave LG the formal right to borrow under strict central-government oversight**. This allowed LG to issue municipal bonds within an allocated quota.
The next step was to **create a municipal-bond market in China**. In this market, investor would be able to assess the risk and return of individual LG borrowers and the municipal bond market would intimately serve as an alternative to land-driven local budgets.

The effort to quickly provide an alternative to land-driven finance was stymied(被阻挠). LGFVs have continued to borrow from banks. Many of the problems associated with the old system are still evident and may grow worse if the government cannot control future borrowing.
On the positive side, new debt instruments have been created, and future borrowing within the authorized quotas will provide new support to the market. It may eventually grow into a new and more reliable source of funding for LG.
